        Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races,
        fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op
        multiplayer for Windows and Mac.

        Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty
        Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to
        accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether
        employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using
        these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick
        travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of
        planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000
        years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they
        attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following
        Galactic Civil War was devastating.

        Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive
        Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson
        though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for
        whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of
        planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises,
        they still turn to an Operative.

        In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing,
        and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy,
        technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can
        contemplate.

        As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those
        annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with
        your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the
        winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if
        you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many
        credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest
        ship in the known universe. Not many screw with an Operative
        captaining a Dreadnaught!
