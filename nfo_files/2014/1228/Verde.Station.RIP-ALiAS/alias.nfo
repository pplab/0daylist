     Verde Station is a first-person story/experience game set on a            
     space station. During your year long solo mission you begin to            
     question the world around you. The game reacts in subtle ways to          
     how you play. On a year long solo mission aboard Verde Station, you       
     will test your wits, question everything, and strain to keep your         
     sanity. Welcome to solitude.                                              
                                                                               
     It is highly recommended that if you like games that aim to               
     surprise you and keep you questioning what's happening, do not read       
     much about the game. The less you know the better experience you'll       
     have. You can only play it for the first time once.                       
                                                                               
     Gameplay:                                                                 
                                                                               
     Verde Station is a game of small details, many of which can easily        
     be missed. It can be considered a mystery box game, walking               
     simulator, exploration game, or story game. At its core, Verde            
     Station is an interactive exploration game that lightly reacts to         
     how you play it. Examine every detail of the station, pick up and         
     view items, and dig into computer terminals. You will uncover clues       
     about the station and have to decide if you can trust what you see        
     and hear. As the answers come, so do more questions.                      
                                                                               
     Features:                                                                 
                                                                               
     Reactive Storytelling: The core story of Verde Station is fixed but       
     depending on how you interact with the game you will have a               
     slightly different experience. The world around you reacts to the         
     type of player you are. These are subtle changes specifically             
     designed to match your personality. They are also specifically            
     designed so you won't notice most of them until a second or third         
     play-through.                                                             
                                                                               
     Interactive Exploration: Examine every item in the station or just        
     a few. Some items even react to how you interact with them. The           
     more you explore, the more story you reveal, and the more you             
     discover about what's really happening. Or so you may think.              
                                                                               
     No combat and no true puzzles: There are a few elements you may           
     need to think through but no true puzzles. But there are rewards          
     for those that explore everything. Go as fast or as slow as you           
     like throughout the station. Only the most engaged players will           
     find everything their first play through. If you interact with the        
     world differently in a second play-through you'll see different           
     things.
