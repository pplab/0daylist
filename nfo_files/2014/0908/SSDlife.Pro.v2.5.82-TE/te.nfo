        SSDlife Pro application provides the possibility to run disk
        checks (scheduled) in the background mode, display detailed
        information about SMART attributes and tweak the system for use
        with SSD drives. 

        SSD reliability analysis
        ï Itís a shame when a drive failure results in all your personal
          data being lost. SSDLife allows you to control how worn your
          SSDs are in an easy and convenient way, which means you can
          control how safely and securely your data is stored on them.

        SSD lifetime calculation
        ï SSD Life analyzes how actively you use your solid-state drive
          and uses a special algorithm to calculate its estimated
          lifetime. Of course, the date of the lifetime expiration is
          corrected depending on how intensively you keep using your
          drive.

        Full drive information
        ï The entire information about your SSD ó from general
          (manufacturer, model) to technical (whether your drive/system
          supports TRIM) ó is displayed in the main window of SSD Life.
          Sometimes you may need it to find out how many hours the drive
          has already been in operation, for example, when you buy a used
          SSD.

        Compatibility with SSDs
        ï SSDLife supports practically all SSDs that are in use ñ from
          the latest Intel models to the time-proven first Vertex models.
          SSDLife has been tested with solid-state drives from most SSD
          manufacturers ñ such as Kingston, OCZ. And even with Apple
          MacBook Air!*

        * in case the Windows operating system is installed on it
