| In War for the Overworld you have the power to create vast dungeons filled   |
| with hordes of evil minions who share a common goal: to crush the bones of   |
| the goodly heroes that dare to enter your unhallowed halls. You will command |
| mighty armies, create vicious traps and cast dastardly spells to overcome the|
| pitifully gallant armies that defend foolish principles such as "honour" and |
|"righteousness" - it's going to be more fun than taking candy from a baby...  |
