        In FTL you experience the atmosphere of running a spaceship
        trying to save the galaxy. It's a dangerous mission, with every
        encounter presenting a unique challenge with multiple solutions.
        What will you do if a heavy missile barrage shuts down your
        shields? Reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to
        escape, power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the
        sky, or take the fight to them with a boarding party? This
        "spaceship simulation roguelike-like" allows you to take your
        ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy
        filled with glory and bitter defeat.
