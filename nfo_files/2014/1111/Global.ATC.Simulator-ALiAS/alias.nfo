     About the Game                                                            
     =============                                                             
                                                                               
     Global ATC Simulator is a standalone simulation of the task of            
     Tower, Approach and Departure controllers. What sets it apart from        
     every other ATC simulation is that it is global, it covers all the        
     major airports in the whole world with literally unprecedented            
     detail. It uses the same (licensed) database as the majority or           
     airliners so for each of the nearly 14.000 airports you will guide        
     aircraft over the correct routing and procedures. And the aircraft        
     you guide will fly as they should and they will be the right type         
     and the right airline for that airport.                                   
                                                                               
     While it includes a ëgamingí mode where ever increasing traffic           
     will test your skills, it is a serious simulation. Not only will          
     you have to keep the aircraft type in mind (a massive Airbus A380         
     will need a lot more room to turn than a Twin Otter) but also the         
     wind and visibility. Traffic flow is irregular, you will find that        
     there are times when your airport simply is not able to handle the        
     traffic and you will need to keep aircraft in holding patterns            
     until things slow down. But keep them there too long and some will        
     start to run low on fuel and will demand to be given landing              
     clearance. You decide if departing traffic needs to give way to           
     arrivals. Every decision has consequences and you will start to           
     understand very fast why air traffic controllers get paid so much         
     money as they do!                                                         
                                                                               
     Global ATC Simulator is created with shared user created content in       
     mind. You can edit virtually every part of the simulator. If you          
     feel B747ís should climb faster you can edit the aircraft file. If        
     your favourite airline buys a new aircraft type you can add it. If        
     there is an airline missing you like you can add it in minutes. And       
     of course sharing these files will make the simulation better for         
     all users.
