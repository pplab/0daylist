        Why would you want to pay the same price or even more for other
        software that has only a small fraction of Auction Auto Bidder's
        features, is harder to use, or isn't reliable? Many people are
        switching to Auction Auto Bidder after trying the others, make
        the right choice now and save your money. With the 60 day
        satisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to loose.

        Why snipe (bid in the last seconds) rather than use eBay's
        proxy-bidding?

        ∑ Win items at a lower cost since no one will have time to outbid
          you, if you bid a long time before the end, eBay will email the
          previous high bidder to let them know they've been outbid so
          they will most likely come back and outbid you causing the
          price to increase, this software prevents this and often pays
          for itself on the first use 
        ∑ Increase your chances of winning since people wont have time to
          outbid you 
        ∑ You can decide to remove your bid up to the last minute since
          it is only sent to eBay in the last seconds

        Also works as a fully featured web browser optimized to make
        browsing eBay faster & easier.


        What are bid groups?

        With bid groups, you can find several listings of an item you
        want, add them all to be sniped and place them in a group. Place
        bids from lowest to highest for the auction ending the soonest to
        the latest respectively (for example, a $30 bid on the listing
        ending in 2 hours, a $35 on the one ending in 17 hours, and a $40
        on the one ending in 1 day). By doing this, the software will
        attempt to win the first one at your lowest bid, if it wins, all
        other bids in the group are canceled, if you're outbid, it will
        try to win the second one and so on. This can double your savings
        compared to using only normal sniping and saves you even more
        time!


        Very easy to use

        Auction Auto Bidder is so simple to use that anyone, including
        novice computer users can be using it within minutes without even
        having to read instructions, thanks to the user friendly
        interface and wizards which make installing and setting up a
        snipe as simple as entering your maximum bid! Auction Auto Bidder
        will automatically retrieve the item details and do the rest.

          and the software will automatically attempt to win one after

          bid or less, and then cancels the bids on the other items in
          the group, this prevents you from having to wait and see if you
          are outbid and then find another item)

          etc. including any combination)

          result pages to allow hands free browsing) 
        ∑ Ability to bid as little as 1 second before the end (although
          this is not recommended due to how eBay prioritizes bids, feel
          free to ask why)

          reliability 
        ∑ Very simple to use, just click the add auction button while and

          bids on time even if your system clock is incorrect. 
        ∑ When an item is ending in less than 5 minutes, the program will
          refresh the details more often and ignore all items ending in
          more than 5 minutes to ensure all resources are available to
          bid on time

        Install autobid_setup.exe.  After install copy precracked exe
        from the Crack folder into Auction Auto Bidder's installed
        folder, making sure to overwrite the existing file.  You now have
        a fully registered version of Auction Auto Bidder Professional!


        IMPORTANT NOTE WE WOULD LIKE TO STATE:

        For awhile now, when you try and close the Autobid client, it
        might not close.  Just make sure its not updating anything from
        EBAY (check the bottom right update notification area and the
        blue updating bar is gone) when you tried and then click exit
        under the file menu again.  This usually always works, click exit
        a few times if needed.  Its best to close down the client
        properly as you don't want corrupted data or the popup nag about
        the program not closing properly when restarted.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
