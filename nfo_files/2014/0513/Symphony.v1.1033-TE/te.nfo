        Your music is under attack, you must liberate it! 

        A mysterious entity is absorbing and corrupting your music before
        your very eyes. You must battle through your own song collection,
        discover items, customize your ship and fight boss enemies to
        liberate the Symphony of Souls and reclaim your music! 

        Symphony is one of the most music-driven games ever made. In this
        vertical shooter, re-experience each of your songs as it becomes
        a unique battlefield driven by intensity and tempo. 

        Your music collection is now an item collection! Each of your
        songs contains an item you can discover, equip and upgrade. Fully
        customize your ship to reach score targets, upgrade items and
        unlock new difficulty levels. 

        Showcase your skill. Symphony's innovative per-song leaderboard
        rewards you more, when you dominate with less powerful weapons.
        Find the loadout that suits your style and show what you can do!

        Install Setup.exe.  Crack is preinstalled, launch the game from
        the shortcut.


        NOTE:

        After the installation of the files to your hard drive, there
        will be a 10 to 15 second delay.  This is because the Sound Track
        has been included and is installed at that time, all in mp3
        format.  Normally this would not be included but this game
        requires some hurtin' tunes for you to play.  You can, and
        should, use your own tunes, maybe some Tiny Tim singing Tiptoe
        Through the Tulips.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
