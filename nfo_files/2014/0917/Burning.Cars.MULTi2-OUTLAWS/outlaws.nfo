        You got close a few times, but never won it: the Trashpit               
        Championship. As skilled behind the wheel as your father was, there     
        was something missing. Maybe it was instinct, maybe ferocity, or the    
        hummingbird beat reactions that success on the track demands.           
                                                                                
        Regardless, his racing days are over; that's why he gave you the keys   
        to his old truck, and a little money to get started. His racing days    
        are over, but yours have just begun...                                  
                                                                                
        Stunning effects, amazing fire, hard racing with bullets - is what      
        you've waited for for so long. Old school gamers can hear               
        'rock'n'roll' in the noise of your madly spinning tires on the start.   
                                                                                
        Just get in the car and try to survive on a track.                      
                                                                                
        Be quick, be smart, be fearless and the Trashpit Cup is yours. And      
        don't forget to take a good minigun and couple of mines, this is        
        necessary for living on the track.
