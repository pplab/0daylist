        Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5 is the next logical step in
        further developing our powerful CAD software for all building
        projects around the house and garden. Version 5 gives you more
        brilliant results in less time and with less effort.

        Highlights
        ∑ Step-by-step project assistant
        ∑ 2D, 3D and cross-section views
        ∑ Smart input and construction aids
        ∑ Integrated roof, staircase and environment builders
        ∑ Realistic light and shadow simulation
        ∑ Extensive object catalog


        Do-it-yourself planning and building

        Are you planning to build a house? Do you intend to redecorate a
        room or garden? Become your own architect and plan and design on
        your very own PC - Ashampoo 3D Architecture 5 makes it possible.


        Easier and more intuitive with ribbons

        You no longer have to navigate through multiple unrelated
        toolbars with tiny icons. Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5 groups
        all features logically and thematically as tabbed toolbars
        (ribbon) with meaningful labels. And the new quick-access toolbar
        hosts all recently used features to save you time and nerves.
        Naturally, you can always go back to the classic toolbar view, if
        required.


        Faster and future-proof with native 64-bit support

        The new 64-bit version gives you access to all of the available
        main memory in your PC. This means more space for graphics and
        complex calculations on systems with more than 3GB of RAM and
        consequently quicker access times for smoother workflows. Don't
        know whether you own a 64-bit system? Ashampoo 3D CAD
        Architecture 5 automatically selects the version ideal for your
        system during installation.


        More beautiful and expressive with custom fill patterns and 3D
        texture displays in 2D

        In previous versions of 3D CAD Architecture, fill patterns were
        entirely based on drawing routines provided by Windows. With
        Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5, this limitation is now gone.
        Create your own patterns from lines, circles, curves etc. and use
        them in your projects. We have already added more than 30 new
        patterns such as reinforced concrete, bricks or parquet flooring.
        Now, you can also apply the many 3D textures in 2D and make your
        rooms look even more realistic. Of course, texture rotating and
        scaling is also possible in 2D views.


        As real as it gets with realistic light and shadow simulation

        How does your house look at night? In direct sunlight? At night?
        Use the integrated light and shadow simulation to find it out.
        Get a real-life picture of your building and also determine
        whether you've placed those solar elements in their ideal spots.
