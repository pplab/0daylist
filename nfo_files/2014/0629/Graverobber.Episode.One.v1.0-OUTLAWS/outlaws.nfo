       Seattle. 1990-something. Sometime past midnight.                        
                                                                               
       Grave robbing is what Sasha’s best at. Top of his class and             
       nationally infamous. But after a tomb heist goes not-so-smoothly,       
       he’s suddenly being haunted by Ellery, the ghost of the particular      
       crypt he robbed.                                                        
                                                                               
       Not wanting to give back the stolen watch, Sasha delves into research   
       about Ellery’s past along with looking for a means to get rid of him.   
       He unexpectedly becomes more and more intrigued by Ellery’s past        
       while he was alive. Meanwhile, the ghost attempts to make Sasha’s       
       life as miserable as possible and an obsessive detective uses           
       whatever means possible to find the graverobber and arrest him.         
                                                                               
       Sasha's only two friends and hope for safety are a skeevy bartender     
       named Barnaby, and his very own wits.
