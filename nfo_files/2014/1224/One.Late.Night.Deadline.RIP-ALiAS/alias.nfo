     One Late Night: Deadline continues the story of One Late Night, a         
     horror/mystery game where you play the role of an office worker           
     caught in the middle of the paranormal activity that has broken out       
     in a seemingly ordinary office building. Freely explore the 5 story       
     office complex that houses several different companies. Look for          
     clues around the offices, read newspapers about local events, hack        
     your colleagues emails ñ anything that might tell you something           
     related to the strange happenings.                                        
                                                                               
     You arrive at your work late in the night. The rain is pouring down       
     and a storm is closing in fast. Everyone has gone home for the day        
     a long time ago, but the lights in the lobby are still on as usual.       
     As you enter the office complex through the main entrance, you            
     immediately feel the emptiness and begin to go over in your head          
     ìwhat the hell you are doing here in the middle of the night?î,           
     when you could be at home getting some well-deserved sleep.               
     However, while your mind is clouded with the details of your              
     precious deadline, you are unaware of lurking danger in the               
     building and what has occurred during the night. Something has been       
     set free; something thatís not from the world of the living. The          
     shadowy and long hallways beckon you as you attempt to unravel the        
     mystery that has befallen the unassuming offices. Has everyone            
     really gone home, or is someone or something still here?

     The entire game revolves around completing objectives and other           
     small tasks. These objectives may trigger at certain points in the        
     game or by witnessing certain events. The objectives does not all         
     have to be completed in a linear fashion, and some does not have to       
     be completed at all.

     You can use your cellphone as a light source in dark areas and            
     shine in the direction you look. You do not have to go on a tedious       
     battery hunt for the flashlight, but it will drain over time. The         
     battery will replenish automatically over time after you put away         
     the cellphone.

     One Late Night: Deadline brings you a parallel dimension where you        
     might see things otherwise not visible to the naked eye. So, if           
     things look bleak and youíve lost your way, use your cellphone to         
     tap into this mysterious second dimension and things will soon            
     become clearer. But beware; you might see more than you wished for.       
                                                                               
     - Computers                                                               
                                                                               
     Along your way you will come across computers that can be                 
     manipulated. You can use these computers to gather clues and              
     information by reading employee emails. However, some computers are       
     locked and require you to use a password, but if you are stuck you        
     can try to hack them. If you find a Hack disc it will help you            
     immensely in the hacking process.

     When your eyes grow weary and you begin feeling tired, you can head       
     for the nearest vending machine to replenish your energy. If you          
     move around for too long without having a drink you will eventually       
     collapse from exhaustion. Running will make you tired much faster.        
     If you are lucky you might find Dexterity tablets that you can eat        
     along the way and instantly restore your energy.

     All security doors are unlocked using keycards. This is the lowest        
     form of security in the building. Some doors also require a code.         
     You start out with a default keycard that lets you in through some        
     doors.
