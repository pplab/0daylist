	  RELEASE NOTES:
	  
	  Floria was a beautiful and prosperous land. Until one day, an evil 
	  sorcerer stole its magic power and locked it into thousands of 
	  colored tiles. The evil sorcerer was defeated, but the magic power 
	  remained locked in these tiles, and the tiles were scattered 
	  throughout the land. Collect these tiles and help return life 
	  to Floria to make it habitable again!
