      €≤   In  the  age  of  Pike  and  Shot, mighty struggles erupted   ≤€
      €≤   across  Europe for causes religious, political or dynastic.   ≤€
      €≤   In  1494  A.D.  The  first  of  the Italian Wars broke out,   ≤€
      €≤   starting  a  long  struggle  for  dominance  in the region,   ≤€
      €≤   involving  many major belligerents such as France, the Holy   ≤€
      €≤   Roman Empire and Spain.                                       ≤€
      €≤   After  years  of  fighting,  the  conflict was not resolved   ≤€
      €≤   until 1559.                                                   ≤€

      €≤   Then  from  1618  until  1648,  The  Thirty Years War raged   ≤€
      €≤   across  Germany  and  beyond,  leaving  devastation  in its   ≤€
      €≤   wake,  but  saw  the rise of great commanders such as Count   ≤€
      €≤   Tilly,  Wallenstein  and  King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden,   ≤€
      €≤   and  rapid  developments in battlefield tactics. The Thirty   ≤€
      €≤   Years  War saw the involvement of great empires such as the   ≤€
      €≤   Spanish and the French empires, as well as the Swedes.        ≤€
      €≤   And  starting  at  1642,  the  English  Civil  War erupted,   ≤€
      €≤   tearing   the   country   apart   between   Royalists   and   ≤€
      €≤   Parliamentarians as the fought for control of the country.    ≤€
      €≤   After  many  musket volleys and cavalry charges, it was the   ≤€
      €≤   famous  Olivier  Cromwell  who  led the Parliamentarians to   ≤€
      €≤   victory, ending the conflict in 1651.                         ≤€
      €≤   All  these  wars  were  fought  during  the age of Pike and   ≤€
      €≤   Shot,  a time where musketeers "gave fire" in a duel to the   ≤€
      €≤   death,  pikeman  held  stolidly against enemy assaults, and   ≤€
      €≤   cavalry  charged to glory or defeat. Now you can march into   ≤€
