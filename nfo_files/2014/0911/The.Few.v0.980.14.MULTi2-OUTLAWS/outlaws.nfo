       About the Game                                                          
       Take command over RAF during the WW2 history turning point, the         
       Battle of Britain!                                                      
                                                                               
       The goal of the game is to defend Great Britain against German          
       bombing raids.                                                          
                                                                               
       The game has two distinct gameplay experiences where:                   
       * The player manages war production and squadron placement              
       * The player organizes patrol routes and tactics                        
                                                                               
       Once combat is initiated the player can lead their squadrons to         
       attack waves of German bombers utilizing simple touch or mouse          
       commands.                                                               
                                                                               
       The game follows the historical timeline very closely, but at the       
       same time - the game mechanics are easy to learn (yet hard to master)   
       and it provides great entertainment for both seasoned and novice        
       players.                                                                
                                                                               
       * There are 8 aircraft types in the game - including of course the      
       famous Supermarine Spitfire!                                            
       * Every pilot is earning his own experience - witness your rookies      
       become aces!                                                            
       * Manage the British war machine - decide what should be built and      
       where                                                                   
       * Fight epic air battles!                                               
       * Lead English, Polish, Czechs, Canadian and New Zealands squadrons     
       to fight for freedom!                                                   
                                                                               
       The game implements ‘German Command AI” which results in each           
       campaign playing out differently. No two games will ever be the same.
