        SSD Life for Ultrabooks

        Do you own a modern and powerful ultrabook? Just for you weíve
        developed the new SSDLife edition - SSDLife for Ultrabook. It
        features full support for your ultrabook and uses minimal
        resources at the same time.


        Full support for ultrabooks

        SSDLife for Ultrabook is specifically designed for ultraportable
        computers. Ultrabooks, which are powerful and lightweight
        laptops, have been our top-priority platform since the very
        start. Ultrabooks allocated in a separate segment


        Minimum system load

        Being originally designed for laptops, SSDLife for Ultrabook puts
        minimum load on your ultraportable device. It uses a very small
        amount of RAM and includes battery-saving modes to deliver the
        best experience.


        Single SSD drive support

        Most ultrabooks and ultraportable laptops are designed to fit
        only one disk. Thatís why weíve optimized SSDLife for Ultrabook
        to deal with a single SSD only. This also helped us to reduce the
        resources used by the program.


        All other features of SSDLife Pro

        SSDLife for Ultrabook supports all other features of the pro
        version, including some unique ones such as checking for firmware
        update and calculation of an SSDís lifetime.


        PRO FEATURES:


        SSD reliability analysis
        ï Itís a shame when a drive failure results in all your personal
          data being lost. SSDLife allows you to control how worn your
          SSDs are in an easy and convenient way, which means you can
          control how safely and securely your data is stored on them.

        SSD lifetime calculation
        ï SSD Life analyzes how actively you use your solid-state drive
          and uses a special algorithm to calculate its estimated
          lifetime. Of course, the date of the lifetime expiration is
          corrected depending on how intensively you keep using your
          drive.

        Full drive information
        ï The entire information about your SSD ó from general
          (manufacturer, model) to technical (whether your drive/system
          supports TRIM) ó is displayed in the main window of SSD Life.
          Sometimes you may need it to find out how many hours the drive
          has already been in operation, for example, when you buy a used
          SSD.

        Compatibility with SSDs
        ï SSDLife supports practically all SSDs that are in use ñ from
          the latest Intel models to the time-proven first Vertex models.
          SSDLife has been tested with solid-state drives from most SSD
          manufacturers ñ such as Kingston, OCZ. And even with Apple
          MacBook Air!*

        * in case the Windows operating system is installed on it
