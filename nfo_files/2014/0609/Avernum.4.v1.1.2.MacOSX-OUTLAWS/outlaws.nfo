        The newest version of Avernum 4 for Macintosh requires OS X 10.3.9     
        or later.                                                              
                                                                               
        The Story:                                                             
                                                                               
        Avernum is a nation underground. Its pale people live in endless       
        miles of tunnels, pits, and gigantic caverns. Some come to Avernum     
        to work the mines. Others come to hunt monsters for their treasure.    
        And some risk life in the underworld because it is the only place      
        where a person can be free from the total rule of the Empire.          
                                                                               
        But life in Avernum just became a lot more dangerous. All at once,     
        everything has gone wrong. The savages and dark creatures of the       
        lower tunnels, once beaten into submission, have returned. Gigantic    
        beasts, shielded by powerful magic, have taken up residence in the     
        cities, wandering and killing at random. And normally peaceful         
        citizens have been afflicted by a strange, overwhelming paranoia,      
        making even regular townsfolk unpredictable and dangerous.             
                                                                               
        Nobody knows why these disasters have occurred. But you, through       
        good luck (or bad), have stumbled upon a clue. And thus, you become    
        involved in a shadowy war and a deadly struggle, which will take you   
        through strange lands, bandit cities, and the darkest depths of the    
        underworld. Your mission: discover who has attacked your homeland,     
        and stop them. Before everything falls apart.
