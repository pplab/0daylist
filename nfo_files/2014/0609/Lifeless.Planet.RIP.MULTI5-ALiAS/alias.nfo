     While seeking life on a distant planet, an astronaut discovers an         
     abandoned Russian town. He suspects his mission is a hoax until a         
     mysterious young woman saves him from a strange and deadly                
     phenomenon... Lifeless Planet is a third-person action-adventure          
     that features an old-school sci-fi story and spectacular                  
     environments in the spirit of classic action-adventures.                  
                                                                               
     After a hard landing on the planet, the astronaut discovers the           
     planet that was reported to be rich with life is instead a barren         
     wasteland. When he goes searching for his crew, he makes a more           
     startling discovery: evidence that humans have already been to this       
     planet years ago! When he comes upon a deserted Soviet-era Russian        
     town, he struggles to make sense of his mission. Did his                  
     light-speed travel to the planet send him back in time? Or is this        
     all some strange Cold War hoax?                                           
                                                                               
     Along the way, the astronaut meets a Russian woman, Aelita, who is        
     somehow able to survive the hostile atmosphere of the planet.             
     Through an unusual natural phenomenon, her skin causes the soil to        
     glow green under her feet. The player must use these glowing tracks       
     as a guide across the planet past treacherous and deadly threats.         
     Is she leading him to safety... or an untimely death?                     
                                                                               
     Lifeless Planet was inspired by Cold War era science fiction              
     stories, posing questions about humankind's desire for space              
     travel. What if you journeyed across the galaxy to another planet,        
     only to find humans had already been there? What kind of person           
     would sign up for a one-way mission, leaving behind planet Earth          
     and everyone they've ever known and love... to go in search of an         
     Earth-like planet?                                                        
                                                                               
     Equipped with a limited-use jet-pack and a mobile robotic arm, the        
     player must use wits and skill to solve puzzles, unravel the              
     mystery, and survive the Lifeless Planet!
