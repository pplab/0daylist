        mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows
        that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others
        on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group
        conferences or in one-to-one private discussions. 

        It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable
        and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers,
        multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support,
        UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray
        notifications, message logging, and more. 

        mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both
        to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide
        range of functions from network communications to playing games. 

        mIRC has been in development for over a decade and is constantly
        being improved and updated with new technologies. The most recent
        changes can be found on the latest news page. 


        Whats New?

        mIRC 7.38 has been released! (November 27th 2014) 
        This is a small update that addresses a number of issues reported
        by users since the last release. It includes improvements,
        changes and fixes to a number of features, including: 

        ∑ Added STARTTLS support using the CAP tls protocol. 
        ∑ Fixed switchbar/treebar display bug that caused windows to be
          displayed in the wrong order. 
        ∑ Added Shift-F3 key support in Scripts Editor to search
          backwards through text. 
        ∑ Fixed timezone/daylight savings bug that was affecting
          timestamping and time/date identifiers. 
        ∑ Changed $sound() to use the TagLib library for improved reading
          of MP3 and other media file formats. 
        ∑ Updated the default DCC accept and ignore file types lists. 
        ∑ Changed $input() to allow entering of longer text and limiting
          text entry to maximum length. 
        ∑ Fixed DCC Get window not being updated when a resume begins. 
        ∑ Fixed DCC Chat speech bug that caused text in a DCC Chat window
          not to be spoken. 
        ∑ Added $envvar(N/name) identifier with .name and .value
          properties to return environment variables. 
        ∑ Changed /server to search servers list using combination of
          server address, group, and description. 
        ∑ Updated libraries to PCRE v8.36 and OpenSSL 1.0.1j. 
        ∑ Other changes and bug fixes. 

        In total there have been around 50 changes since the last release
        and although most of them are only small fixes and tweaks, we
        hope that they result in a more useful and stable mIRC for you.

        Install mirc738.exe.  After installation copy precracked exe from
        the Crack folder to the installed folder of mIRC.  Launch mIRC
        and use ANY information for registration.  You now have a fully
        activated version of mIRC!  This version is also compatible with
        the fish_10, just make sure you install the latest version of
        fish_10.


        IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PORTABLE INSTALL:

        If you choose to make a portable install while doing the
        installation its important to note that the registration info is
        then stored in mIRC.ini on your portable device.  If you copy
        over your mIRC.ini from your Windows Program Files/User
        installation of mIRC, then when you launch mIRC it will ask for a
        key again (if you have entered one before) because this time it
        started to look in your registry.

        Either don't copy your old ini over, or make sure to find, then
        copy and paste the [user] section from the portable version ini
        into your old ini you plan on using.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
