     There are only two constants in Abyss Odyssey: a great evil awaits        
     at the bottom of the pit, and you must succeed or die.                    
                                                                               
     From indie Chilean developer ACE Team comes a new side-scrolling          
     action adventure game featuring a complex fighting engine in              
     procedurally generated levels that destines its three warriors to         
     battle for an eternity. Enter the bold Katrien, the tortured              
     specter Ghost Monk, and the ethereal Pincoya. Use the characters to       
     perform combos, chaining attacks and releasing a flurry of blows in       
     order to survive what lies beneath. Your path into the unknown may        
     start out with three fierce warriors, but when you learn to possess       
     your enemies, you can challenge the abyss with their skills and           
     combat abilities. Each foe is as technically complex as the main          
     warriors, so use all the options available to you and attempt to          
     figure out the infinite abyss.                                            
                                                                               
     With side-scrolling levels that never play out the same way twice,        
     you'll have a fresh experience every game as you face monsters,           
     find life-saving merchants, and uncover treasures.                        
                                                                               
     Begin your downward journey into the depths of the unknown.               
                                                                               
     Features:                                                                 
                                                                               
     - Deep combat system that takes cues and mechanics from the fighting      
       game genre. All playable characters have an expansive set of basic      
       and special attacks unique to each of them, along with a host of        
       universal mobility options and advanced tecnhiques. Practice your       
       moves and develop new combos in the Training room, where you can        
       select any character you've unlocked in game, including the             
       enemies.                                                                
                                                                               
     - Procedurally generated levels ensure no delve into the Abyss is         
       the same. The rooms of the Abyss with their various twists and          
       traps are randomized on every entry. Enemy spawns, equipment and        
       items to be found, special characters to encounter, and more are        
       different each and every time you play.                                 
                                                                               
     - Unlock up to three hero characters to level up, earn skills, and        
       collect equipment, then customize it all to best suit your play         
       style. Leveling up earns skills points to upgrade each hero's           
       unique skills a variety of ways, while various weapons and              
       accessories can be equipped to grant them new abilities ranging         
       from freezing opponents to cursing them.                                
                                                                               
     - Play as any character you encounter in the gameóeven the bosses.        
       Unleash your hero's ultra attack to steal enemies' souls, allowing      
       you take their form. Discover brand new move sets and character         
       styles as you capture over 30 enemies, each as complex and advanced     
       as the three heroes.                                                    
                                                                               
     - Work as a community to defeat the final boss together. When the         
       collective community of Abyss Odyssey players defeats the final         
       boss enough times, his mask breaks to reveal a new identity. Each       
       time this is achieved, new content will be unlocked in game,            
       including new enemies and other dynamics.                               
                                                                               
     - Beautiful visuals inspired by Art Nouveau, showcasing a story rich      
       in Chilean culture. The flowing lines and beautiful organic styling     
       of Art Nouveau can be seen from the game's UI to its character          
       design. Set in late 19th-century Santiago, those characters and the     
       game's story also draw heavy inspiration from Chilean folklore and      
       mythology.                                                              
                                                                               
     - Play the campaign solo or with a friend in online or local              
       cooperative multiplayer. A second player can drop in or drop out at     
       any time to join you in your journey down the Abyss.                    
                                                                               
     - Bonus versus mode allows up to 4 players to test their skills           
       against each other. Fight it out in special arenas developed for        
       free-for-all or team-based competitive multiplayer. Use any             
       character you've unlocked in game, hero or enemy, for dozens of         
       characters to choose from.
