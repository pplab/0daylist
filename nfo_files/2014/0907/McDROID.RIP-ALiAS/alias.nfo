     A fast-paced, tough as nails Third Person Arcade Tower Defense,           
     McDROID will challenge both your trigger finger and your wits as          
     you multitask like a robotic spider-doggy: running, shooting,             
     building your base, controlling, healing, harvesting, repairing,          
     planting, upgrading and researching - all at the same time.               
                                                                               
     Defend your shuttle against a variety of crazed alien species as          
     they mutate, corrupt the ground or even turn your crops against           
     you. Load up on, play solo campaign or join in up to 3 people in          
     survival arenas and take the battle to the enemy. If it gets too          
     crazy, turtle up behind your defensive perimeter and assume direct        
     control of the turrets.                                                   
                                                                               
     Doggy-robot McDROID and her friend SHUTTLE crash land on their way        
     home to Planet M. The entire fauna has been mutated by something          
     and the Planet no longer speaks - she is very ill. Plant trees,           
     build, defend and outwit critters on your way to heal your Planet's       
     hearts with the help of your research lab, your upgrades and your         
     pet bots. And don't let these giant strawberries rot.

     - Hard as nail Survival Levels with persistence: your towers and

       play on in Challenge and Nightmare modes. Your base and economy
