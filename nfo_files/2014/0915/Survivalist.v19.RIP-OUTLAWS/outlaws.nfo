        It's one year after the collapse of civilisation and hedge fund         
        manager Joe Wheeler emerges from his specially constructed bunker in    
        search of food.                                                         
                                                                                
        This is a story-driven survival game where the aim is to find other     
        survivors, gain their respect, and build a community.                   
                                                                                
        You'll have to maintain a steady insulin supply for a diabetic woman,   
        solve the mystery of why certain people have disappeared from a         
        nearby community, and search for a truck full of stolen gold bullion    
        that will make you unimaginable wealthy in the new gold-based           
        economy.                                                                
                                                                                
        You'll scavenge for supplies, trade, plant crops, go on quests, face    
        moral dilemmas, go to war, and uncover dark, terrible secrets! Or you   
        could just kill everyone you meet, it probably won't get you very far   
        but the choice is yours.
