       Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids    
       and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye     
       can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his      
       two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the      
       crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at       
       night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security        
       guard than to find a repairman.                                         
                                                                               
       From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully.   
       You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to    
       use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you    
       run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more      
       lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends   
       aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and   
       protect yourself if needed!                                             
                                                                               
       Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?                                
                                                                               
       "For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five        
       Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how      
       cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience     
       terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the   
       show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot        
       about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and     
       toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone    
       who likes scary games." -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com
