|    Here we are. Ten years after our very first release. Ten fucking years,  |
|    hell, a fucking decade! We can rarely believe this, but we are still     |
|    here. And we are here to stay.                                           |
|                                                                             |
|    When we started in 2004 the scene has been different. It changed quite   |
|    much regarding the people and the groups. But some people are still      |
|    around, trying to keep our old values.                                   |
|                                                                             |
|    During the last ten years, we saw a lot groups come and go.              |
|    Some of them were pretty good groups and a contributed to the entire     |
|    scene - the others have been rather evitable. But we were always there.  |
|    Sometimes more active, sometimes less, but still: Always around.         |
|                                                                             |
|    We also saw sites come and go and only a few of them outlasted us so     |
|    far. Some of those jewels will really be missed. This is where we would  |
|    like to thank all of our former and current affiliation sites.           |
|    Especially our current (and our former) World Headquarter.               |
|    Our former European Headquarter and our Member Headquarters and our      |
|    beloved Archive Headquarters. Also any other sites we may have forgotten.|
|                                                                             |
|    For obvious reasons we cannot mention these sites here - even tho we     |
|    would love to publically mention all of them here.                       |
|                                                                             |
|    We also like to thank all the people who supplied software during all    |
|    these years.                                                             |

|    Last but not least we would like to thank all our current (and former)   |
|    members. You are what made us be, what we are. It has been a great honor |
|    to work with you during all these years. Many greetings go to those who  |
|    are not able to be with us this evening, because they had to quit the    |
|    scene for whatever reason. THANK YOU GUYS - YOU ARE FUCKING AWESOME!     |
|                                                                             |
