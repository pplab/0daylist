    ≤€≤  Silo 2 is a focused 3D modeling application with the       ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  ability to effortlessly switch between organically         ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  sculpting high-polygon models and precisely controlling    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  hard-edged surfaces. It can be used for anything from      ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  creating 3D characters for video games and movies to       ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  quickly exploring 3D architectural ideas.                  ≤€≤

    ≤€≤  Silo is currently being used at top studios worldwide as   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  both a stand-alone design tool and as a versatile element  ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  of a multi-software 3D graphics workflow.                  ≤€≤

    ≤€≤  Silo brings 3D modeling zen to artists via a clean,        ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  focused environment and a streamlined toolset, honed over  ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  years of development. It was initially born of our own     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  frustration with the needless complexity and slow,         ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  unmanageable workflows of all-in-one graphics software.    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  We single-mindedly devoted Silo to modeling, discovering   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  that the modeling workflow could be made much simpler      ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  without sacrificing any power. This unique approach has    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  attracted in equal number students, hobbyists, and         ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  professional artists in film, games, architecture, and     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  other fields looking to maximize their production. (Read   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  interviews with professional artists using Silo.)          ≤€≤
    ≤€≤                                                             ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  At Silo's heart is an innovative, robust, and 100%         ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  customizable polygon editing toolset, suitable to both     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  organic and hard-surface modeling. This polygonal base     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  mesh is used to drive subdivision surfaces if desired:     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  just hit C and V to navigate between subdivision levels    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  and the base mesh at any time. Those coming to Silo from   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  other applications will find that, despite having fewer    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  tools, Silo isn't lacking any functionality. Instead,      ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  basic modeling tools such as Tweak, Cut, Bevel, Extrude,   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  and Slide intelligently adapt to the task at hand based    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  on context, drastically cutting down on the time spent     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  switching or hunting for tools. (Watch                     ≤€≤

    ≤€≤  On top of this core toolset we've added non-destructive    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  brush-based displacement painting (especially useful for   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  high res meshes or directly editing subdivision layers),   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  advanced uv unwrapping, and the unique Topology Brush      ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  which lets you literally draw a new edge flow onto a 3D    ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  surface. Intuitive, advanced selection tools including     ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  Tweak, Loop, Ring, Path, Grow/Shrink, and Soft Selection   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  are key to a fast, fluid workflow. (Watch how Tweak lets   ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  you instantly grab and adjust points, edges, and faces to  ≤€≤
    ≤€≤  organically reshape the model.)                            ≤€≤
