     much more!                                                                
                                                                               
     This is as close as you'll get to sitting in a GM's office without        
     drawing a paycheck from a team. Oversee team finances, keep an eye

     offers to free agents, and draft the newest generation of stars.

     best results out of your team: Find the line combinations that            
     work, give your young stars playing time to help them develop, and        
     give specific instructions to each line and defensive pair.
