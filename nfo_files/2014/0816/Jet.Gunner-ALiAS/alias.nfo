     Jet Gunner is a 2D platform action indie game that's full of              
     Nestalgia. Full of action, gunfights, bosses and explosions so if         
     you're into the whole 8-Bit vibe you should love this. From the           
     sound, to the graphics to the flicker, this should pay tribute to         
     those classic hard as nails, run 'n' gun games. Hopefully this            
     should wet your appetite for re-living the good ol' days.

     - First, I've edited so the game doesn't use directx9, however there                                  
       is a version of the game that uses it included in the Steamapps                                     
       folder of this game. This should hopefully clear any bugs/issues                                    
       with full-screen.                                                                                   
                                                                                                           
     - I've taken out support for controllers. With so many complains of                                   
       it not working, it was doing more bad than good so I've got rid of                                  
       it. As the game was designed originally as a flash game, controller                                 
       support is difficult to include. I've taken it out for now, but I                                   
       might work on it with more time and include a patch to re-instate it                                
       once it's more finished.                                                                            
                                                                                                           
     - The game now can save offline and doesn't need the use of Steam                                     
       being online.                                                                                       
                                                                                                           
     - The game also now saves your option selections. I've also added in                                  
       more options for keys                                                                               
                                                                                                           
     - There is now a bonus game in the Steamapp folder of this game,                                      
       called Alien Splatter that I made for flash a while back. This is to                                
       say sorry for the rocky start of the game.
