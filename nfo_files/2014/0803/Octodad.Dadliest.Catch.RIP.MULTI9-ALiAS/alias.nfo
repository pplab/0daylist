     Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a game about destruction, deception, and       
     fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus                 
     masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's             
     existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks         
     with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping         
     his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.                   
                                                                               
     In this sequel to the splash hit Octodad, our cephaloprotagonist          
     has gotten himself in a bind between his wifeís mounting mistrust,        
     and a disastrous trip to the local aquarium! Are you dad enough to        
     control the titular octopus father as he strives to hide his              
     nautical nature from his family while keeping his tangled tentacles       
     intact?                                                                   
                                                                               
     In Octo-ber 2010, a group of university students released the             
     original Octodad into the world. Despite everyone being convinced         
     that the game was about a normal human dad, the game was a cult           
     hit, gained critical acclaim, and was an Independent Games Festival       
     Student Finalist in 2011. Octodad received enough attention that          
     the team decided to run a Kickstarter, form the game studio Young         
     Horses, and create a bigger, better, more polished game about             
     Octodad. Two and a half years after beginning production, Octodad:        
     Dadliest Catch is ready to flop awkwardly into your arms.
