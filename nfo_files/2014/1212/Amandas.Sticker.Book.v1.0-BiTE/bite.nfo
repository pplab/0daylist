	  RELEASE NOTES:
	  
	  Amanda's Sticker Book is an exciting match-3 puzzle game that's fun 
	  for both kids and adults! Put your matching skills to the test as 
	  you swap stickers and use power-ups to clear each puzzle. Amanda is 
	  counting on your match-3 talents to make her dreams come true! 

	  The annual sticker book competition is just around the corner, but 
	  Amanda's masterpiece has been ruined by her haphazard little brother. 
	  There isn't much time to fix it and Amanda will need all the help she 
	  can get. To restore the sticker book, you'll complete 79 puzzle 
	  levels spread across five different rooms, each one filled with 
	  stickers to swap and match. Special power-ups let you clear out those 
	  tough to reach stickers, and with each stage you complete, Amanda's 
	  sticker book will be one step closer to perfection. Match as fast as 
	  you can. Amanda can't do this without you!
