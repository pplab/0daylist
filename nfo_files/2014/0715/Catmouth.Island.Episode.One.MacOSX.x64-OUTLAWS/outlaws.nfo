          It's simple: You point and click where you want the           
          character to go, and the same goes for all kinds of           
          interactions. You can choose between two zoom-levels and      
          rotate the camera to get a better view of things.             
          You play as Mya, a 19 year old student who also has a thing   
          for solving puzzles, and must guide her across the three      
          islands that collectively form the Catface Islands            
          (Catmouth Island being the biggest). Meet and interact with   
          the local population, trek in the mountains and go to the     
          beach; all in the search for that next quest object to        
          complete. :3                                                  
                                                                        
          Features                                                      
                                                                        
              Over 60 NPCs to talk to, ranging from human to            
          non-human, and around 2000 lines of dialogue.                 
              Unique location based theme music.                        
              The feeling of playing an oldskool adventure game but     
          with a different graphical twist.                             
              Nintendo 64-style low-poly models combined with today's   
          technology. Every human NPC has a polygon budget of less      
          than 300.                                                     
              Two classes of NPCs: Relevant and irrelevant, with a      
          lot of things to say.                                         
              Relevant NPCs can have long dialogue trees.               
              Episodic progression. Each episode will advance the       
          game and the story through its characters and surroundings.   
              Just like the old adventure games you can take, use,      
          combine, give and receive items to complete puzzles.          
              Explore the whole island group from the start.            
          Everywhere is accessible at any time (with the exception of   
          Guinea Peak).                                                 
              Use the overlay map teleport function to quickly move     
          from area to area in case you are impatient, but will only    
          work with areas you have already visited.                     
              A bit more logical puzzle system that addresses the       
          shortcomings of previous adventure games.                     
              Horizontal camera rotation to look around the             
          surroundings.                                                 
              A zoom-in function to study things up close.              
              A highlight-function to help you show what you can click. 
              A scrapbook with a task list that you can refer to if     
          you don't know what to do in case you should get stuck or     
          return to the game at a later time.
