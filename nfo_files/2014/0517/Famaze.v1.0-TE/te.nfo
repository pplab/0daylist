        Famaze is a retro themed puzzle adventure game. The game combines
        charming SNES era visuals and sound, randomized "roguelike"mazes,
        strategy and puzzles, rpg elements, and a fun lighthearted story.
        The game is simple to pick up but offers endless replay because
        of the procedural nature of its levels.

        happy rutabagas of the land and has turned them into evil
        monsters to guard his kingdom while he searches for the elusive
        perfect recipe for rutabaga pudding. The heroes of the land (a
        knight, thief, or wizard) must delve deep into the king's domain
        to rescue the rutabagas, find the gem of truth to unravel the
        secret recipe and put a stop to the mad king's plot.
