          Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave     
          Story features a completely original storyline wrapped with   
          personality, mystery, and classic 2D action! Equally

          critically acclaimed independent designer, Daisuke Amaya.     
          Now officially available for the first time on a console,     
          Cave Story takes the addictive classic 2D gameplay formula    
          and brings it up to speed with all-new audio-visuals and 10   
          highly potent and destructive weapons, each with three
