        CAD for professionals - Plan, visualize and communicate

        Are you in the construction business? Are you a designer,
        draftsman, interior or landscape architect that create blueprints
        that have to meet professional requirements? Plan, visualize and
        communicate your design ideas professionally and fuss-free - with
        Ashampoo 3D CAD Professional 5. Our software helps you create
        plan sections for building applications or construction
        documentation. Use powerful features to achieve technical
        excellence and rely on extensive modeling capabilities to design
        your own construction elements or sculptures and add an artistic
        touch to your building creations. 


        Efficient and clear

        With a clear, thematically structured interface, every function
        is just one click away. All interface elements are logically
        arranged and quickly accessible. Select between classic toolbars
        or a modern ribbon interface popularized though Microsoft Office.

 
        With input aids and wizards against complexity

        From roof designs to landscape planning - Ashampoo 3D CAD
        Professional 5 provides highly useful input aids and wizards for
        all complex operations. You focus on contents, our software does
        the rest - as it should be. 


        Exterior and interior design elements included

        The integrated object catalog comes with a huge number of
        construction elements, textures, materials and symbols. This
        includes doors, windows, balconies and carports to sanitary and
        electrical installations including photovoltaic elements, all
        instantly positionable with a single click. This gives you a
        highly detailed picture of the finished product. 


        Realistic light and shadow simulations

        The integrated light and shadow simulations give you a real-life
        picture of your buildings and help determine the ideal locations
        for modern photovoltaic panels. 


        Project import and export

        Import and export 2D DXF- and DWF projects directly from within
        the program and exchange data effortlessly with other CAD
        applications. Export to Maxon Cinema 4D format for further
        processing to achieve extra visual polish for project
        presentations. 

        Plan, visualize and communicate your design ideas professionally
        and fuss-free - with Ashampoo 3D CAD Professional 5



        Faster and future-proof with native 64-bit support

        The new 64-bit version gives you access to all of the available
        main memory in your PC. This means more space for graphics and
        complex calculations on systems with more than 3GB of RAM and
        consequently quicker access times for smoother work flows.
        Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5 automatically selects the version
        ideal for your system during installation. 


        More creative with custom fill patters and 3D texture displays in
        2D

        Ashampoo 3D CAD Professional 5 no longer depends on OS-specific
        drawing routines for fill patterns. Now, you can create your own
        patterns from lines, circles, curves etc. and use them in your
        projects. We have already added more than 30 new patterns such as
        reinforced concrete, bricks or parquet flooring. Naturally, you
        can also create patterns and symbols from DXF files and apply the
        many 3D textures in 2D to make your rooms look even more
        realistic. Of course, 2D views fully support texture rotating and
        scaling.
