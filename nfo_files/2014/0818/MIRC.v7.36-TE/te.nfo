        mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows
        that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others
        on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group
        conferences or in one-to-one private discussions. 

        It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable
        and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers,
        multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support,
        UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray
        notifications, message logging, and more. 

        mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both
        to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide
        range of functions from network communications to playing games. 

        mIRC has been in development for over a decade and is constantly
        being improved and updated with new technologies. The most recent
        changes can be found on the latest news page. 


        Whats New?

        mIRC 7.36 has been released! (August 14th 2014) 

        This is a small update that addresses a number of issues reported
        by users since the last release. It includes improvements,
        changes and fixes to a number of features, including: 

        ∑ Fixed slow mark/copy text in windows that contain long lines.
        ∑ Fixed listbox lines in Options dialog and other windows being
          chopped when DPI settings are set to a high value.
        ∑ Reverted change to alias/identifiers that caused a script to be
          halted with a recursion error warning.
        ∑ Fixed listbox with checkboxes bug that caused checkboxes to be
          checked if you scrolled through them with the up/down keys.
        ∑ Changed channel folder dialog so that it can now be resized.
        ∑ Changed online timer dialog to display information more
          clearly.
        ∑ Fixed Shift+Tab beeping when switching to listbox in channel
          window.
        ∑ Fixed $fullscreen not working on a non-primary monitor.
        ∑ Updated the find/replace dialogs in the script editor to
          remember their positions for the current mIRC session.
        ∑ Updated mIRC to include OpenSSL support without needing
          external DLLS.
        ∑ Fixed lock dialog bug that caused mIRC to ask for a password if
          the on startup option was enabled without setting a password.
        ∑ Fixed $input() 'b' switch so that the dialog window close
          button is also temporarily disabled.
        ∑ Fixed isignore only accepting types, now also accepts switches.
        ∑ Fixed CAP server-time time value not being used when
          timestamping an event in the log file.
        ∑ Other changes and bug fixes. 

        In total there have been around 25 changes since the last release
        and although most of them are only small fixes and tweaks, we
        hope that they result in a more useful and stable mIRC for you.

        Install mirc736.exe.  After installation copy precracked exe from
        the Crack folder to the installed folder of mIRC.  Launch mIRC
        and use ANY information for registration.  You now have a fully
        activated version of mIRC!  This version is also compatible with
        the fish_10, just make sure you install the latest version of
        fish_10.


        IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PORTABLE INSTALL:

        If you choose to make a portable install while doing the
        installation its important to note that the registration info is
        then stored in mIRC.ini on your portable device.  If you copy
        over your mIRC.ini from your Windows Program Files/User
        installation of mIRC, then when you launch mIRC it will ask for a
        key again (if you have entered one before) because this time it
        started to look in your registry.

        Either don't copy your old ini over, or make sure to find, then
        copy and paste the [user] section from the portable version ini
        into your old ini you plan on using.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
