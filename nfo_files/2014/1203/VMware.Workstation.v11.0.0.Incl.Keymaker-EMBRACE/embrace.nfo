       |  * Indispensable Tool for Professionals                       |
       |  Automate and streamline tasks to save time and improve       |
       |  productivity. Run applications in Linux, Windows, and more   |
       |  at the same time on the same PC with no rebooting. Evaluate  |
       |  and test new operating systems, applications and patches in  |
       |  an isolated environment. Demonstrate complex software        |
       |  applications on a single laptop in a repeatable, reliable    |
       |  manner. Rich integration with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and    |
       |  the SpringSource Tool Suite make it incredibly easy to       |
       |  debug applications on multiple platforms.                    |
       |                                                               |
       |  * More Reasons at a Glance                                   |
       |  Seamlessly Integrated:                                       |
       |  Unity mode integrates applications from within your Windows  |
       |  & Linux virtual machines and makes them appear like they     |
       |  are running on your native desktop. User friendly features   |
       |  such as the ability to cut and paste pictures, drag and      |
       |  drop email attachments, and driver-less printing make it     |
       |  easy to work in a virtual machine.                           |
       |                                                               |
       |  Snapshots and Clones: The Ultimate Time Saver                |
       |  Snapshots preserve the state of a virtual machine so you     |
       |  can return to it at any time. Snapshots are useful when you  |
       |  need to revert your virtual machine to a prior, stable       |
       |  system state. Workstation makes it easy to find and revert   |
       |  to a previously saved snapshot.                              |
       |                                                               |
       |  Installing operating systems and applications can be time    |
       |  consuming. With clones, you can make many copies of a        |
       |  virtual machine from the baseline installation and           |
       |  configuration. This makes it fast and simple to maintain     |
       |  standardized computing environments for employees and        |
       |  students, or to create a baseline configuration for          |
       |  testing.                                                     |
       |                                                               |
       |  Run Multi-tiered Applications on a Single PC                 |
       |  Manage multiple, network-connected virtual machines with     |
       |  Teams. Teams make it easy to start and run complex multi-    |
       |  tier enterprise applications on a single PC with just a      |
       |  click of the mouse.                                          |
       |                                                               |
       |  Rewind and Replay Until You Find the Bug                     |
       |  Diagnose non-deterministic bugs with the Replay Debugging    |
       |  technology integrated into Visual Studio and Eclipse. Test   |
       |  your applications in a virtual machine while recording and   |
       |  then let the developer step through the recording with a     |
       |  debugger attached. Never again will there be a non-          |
       |  reproducible bug.                                            |
