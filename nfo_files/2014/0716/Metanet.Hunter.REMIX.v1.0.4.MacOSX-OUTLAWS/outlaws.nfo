          It's finally here! The second entry in the Metanet Hunter     
          series is live and kicking. This time, it's sure to rock      
          your world. And you know that's worth saying radical.         
                                                                        
          Why, it's Metanet Hunter: REMIX! Brought to you by the same   
          guys who made you Metanet Hunter, and a new bodacious         
          artist. This time, we're bringing retro action to an          
          entirely different level.                                     
                                                                        
          Features:                                                     
                                                                        
          8 brand-spanking new worlds! They're all wildly different     
          and totally cool.                                             
          Radical new art! The artist really took his time to make      
          this game groovy.                                             
          An even better remixed soundtrack! Made by the same guy who   
          brought you Metanet Hunter's soundtrack, and it's even        
          better this time. Filled with diverse themes and some         
          high-energy head-banging goodness.                            
          Upgrades, upgrades, upgrades! There's two shiny new armor     
          upgrades for you to obliterate those orbs! Think you can      
          get 'em?                                                      
          Extreme challenge! It's much tougher to beat this game up     
          than Metanet Hunter, and it'll have you on your knees         
          beggin' for mercy. But don't worry, we kept it fair. We       
          also kept it totally rad.
