        Latest Release - RoboForm Enterprise Version 7 adds three
        exciting features, making RoboForm Enterprise even more powerful,
        simpler to use, and easier to implement.
 
        ï Enhanced non-web logins to support most Win32 based
          applications making RoboForm enterprise the ideal solution for
          both web and non-web-based applications.
        ï Integration with Windows Logon. RoboForm Enterprise now
          integrates with your existing Windows logon, effectively
          enabling employee password management without any additional
          passwords to remember.
        ï New biometric option can replace the master password with
          fingerprint authentication.
 
 
 
        Features:
 
        Out-of-the-box password management features that your employees
        will actually use and appreciate
 
        RoboForm Enterprise comes with these out-of-the box features and
        requires no extensive setup or implementation. Your organization
        can start using and benefiting from these features right away!
 
        Intuitive User Interface that Automatically ?Learns? and
        ?Remembers? Passwords 
 
        ï There is only one password to remember. All of your employees?
          passwords are protected using a ?Master Password?. So they
          remember one Master Password, and RoboForm Enterprise remembers
          the rest.
        ï When a user enters a new password, RoboForm Enterprise simply
          prompts to save and store this new password for the employee
          and subsequently logs them in automatically.
        ï Originally built for consumers and used by millions of users
          worldwide, the software is extremely user friendly and designed
          to simplify password management to meet the needs of the most
          novice user. Users can be up and running quickly with little to
          no training required.
 
 
        Powerful Password Protection 
 
        ï Stores employee passwords in encrypted ?Passcards? using
          industry-standard AES encryption with a single, Master Password
          as a key.
        ï Master Password protected on the client and known only to
          employee, keeping it confidential and secured from outsiders.
        ï Offers a ?dual master password? capability that allows managers
          or IT staff to share credentials for accessing applications
          with other employees, without sharing the actual
          username/password.
        ï Offers a secure password generator to help you increase
          password security, allowing you to create and enforce more
          complex passwords enterprise-wide. Automatically generates
          secure, randomized passwords without burdening employees.
 
 
        Flexible, Enterprise-Wide Implementation and Administration
 
        ï Automates installation for fast, non-disruptive, mass rollout
          across the enterprise.
        ï Allows for offline RoboForm Enterprise activation.
        ï Is compatible with most automated software install programs,
          making it as easy to install on 1,000 computers as it is on
          one.
        ï Using centralized policy editor, allows you to easily customize
          user access to every option and feature available in RoboForm
          Enterprise, by showing/hiding functionality.
 
 
        Easy and Seamless Integration
 
        ï Requires no up-front integration effort or no team of
          consultants to plan, integrate, or make changes to your
          existing application infrastructure, saving significant time
          and development costs (that would be required of traditional
          SSO solutions).
        ï Eliminates the need for your implementation staff to collect
          and store user credentials, determine login resources or
          enforce password standards enterprise-wide since RoboForm
          Enterprise does this automatically.
        ï Continues to work as systems evolve automatically, with no
          additional integration work or infrastructure changes required.
        ï Relies on existing mechanisms, i.e., securely stores and
          ?remembers? usernames and passwords, thus, eliminating the need
          to change user profiles or applications.
        ï Supports virtually all the business applications your employees
          need to access including legacy systems.
        ï Supports integration into multiple environments. Any user,
          employee, partner, or other stakeholder can benefit whether
          they use 3rd party applications and systems.
        ï Once configured, allows for secure remote access, on and
          off-network for mobile employees.
 
 
        Conforms to Strict Company Password Standards, Policies and Other
        Authentication Methods
 
        RoboForm Enterprise helps you to ensure stronger password
        management practices and policies without increasing IT costs.
 
        ï Supports your company?s particular standards for strong
          passwords, biometric authentication, fingerprint
          authentication, application access and deny lists, etc.
        ï By using the convenient, centralized Policy Editor, lets you
          quickly customize and enforce enterprise policies for password
          requirements including password length and complexity, password
          re-sets/expiration, white-listed or black-listed Web sites,
          etc. The Policy Editor is so easy to use, you can customize
          every feature in RoboForm Enterprise in less than 30 minutes!
 
 
        Highly Robust and Scalable Solution
 
        ï Scales up to support many thousands of users. Because it was
          originally designed as a consumer-based product back in 1999,
          RoboForm Enterprise has been effectively field-tested by
          millions of users with tens of millions of usernames and
          passwords.
 
 
        Secure, Distributed Architecture with No Single Point of Attack
 
        ï Is installed on individual clients, which makes the application
          highly available. As long as the client is working and
          applications to which the user needs to login are available,
          the software is operational.
        ï Encrypts and stores each employees? Passcards on individual
          clients, ensuring that no ?keys to the kingdom? are available
          for phishers, keyloggers or hackers to compromise an
          enterprise?s password storehouse.
 
 
        Advanced Identity Theft and Fraud Protection
 
        ï Fights ?Phishing? by linking sensitive login information only
          to the correct URL. RoboForm Enterprise will only recognize
          valid URLs that are associated with login information. A fake
          site would not be recognized and therefore login information
          would not be provided automatically.
        ï Defeats Keyloggers. RoboForm Enterprise does not require using
          a keyboard to type passwords. RoboForm Enterprise offers the
          option of a Virtual Keyboard to "type" the Master Password; and
          keyloggers cannot detect it. The Virtual Keyboard is an image
          of a keyboard on the screen in which users click the images of
          the keyboard buttons. Since there are no keystrokes, there's
          nothing for the keylogger to detect or transmit.
 
 
        Portability
 
        ï A portable version, RoboForm2Go, is available to run from a USB
          Flash Drive. This version allows your employees to securely
          take their passwords, contacts and bookmarks with them.
        ï Ensures that employees access Web site applications securely,
          even from unsecured public computers.
 
 
 
        Benefits:
 
        Delivering Fast, Simplified, and Cost-Effective Password
        Management
 
        ï RoboForm Enterprise is a full-featured, out-of-the-box password
          management solution that provides a secure, easy and
          cost-effective way to manage all of your employees? numerous
          passwords. It reduces their numerous logins to one master
          password, making your employees more productive while saving
          significant time and IT costs for your organization.
 
 
        Increased Employee Productivity & Satisfaction with a Single,
        Secure Login to All Applications
 
        ï Reduces the time-consuming login process and automatically logs
          users into the business applications they use every day. Your
          employees remember one password, RoboForm Enterprise remembers
          the rest.
        ï Eliminates employee distraction and frustration caused by
          forgotten passwords, allowing employees to focus on their jobs.
        ï Eliminates the risks of unsafe employee habits like writing
          down passwords, storing them in unprotected files, using the
          same password, or openly sharing passwords with others.
        ï Makes password management easy and meets the needs of the most
          novice user. Users can be up and running quickly with little
          to no training required.
 
 
        Instant IT Savings, Reducing the Burden on Helpdesk Staff
 
        ï The self-service nature of RoboForm Enterprise, translates
          directly into instant relief for your IT or helpdesk staff
          since they are no longer disrupted by employees? numerous
          password re-set requests.
        ï Enables you to enforce strong password policies that your
          employees will actually follow. Your company can take advantage
          of stronger password management practices, while staying
          focused on more critical enterprise IT projects.
 
 
        Cost-Effective with Rapid ROI
 
        ï Is licensed per user at a reasonable price point at a fraction
          of the cost of traditional SSO solutions, with volume discounts
          available. 
        ï Helps you realize significant savings and immediate ROI with
          more productive employees and with significant IT cost
          reduction by eliminating help desk calls to reset passwords. In
          many cases, this factor alone helps you quickly recover the
          low-cost, up-front investment in purchasing the software.
 
        Most companies experience a positive ROI in less than three
        months just from help desk savings!
 
 
        Immediate Results with Fast and Easy Roll Out, No Integration or
        Infrastructure Changes
 
        ï Offers a simplified implementation process so that the software
          can be up and running in minutes.
        ï Administrators have the flexibility to mass rollout as well as
          quickly customize and control password settings as needed.
        ï Does not require you to hire a team of consultants to plan and
          implement, nor integrate or make changes to your application
          infrastructure.
 
 
 
        How It Works:
 
        The trouble with strict password policies is that employees won't
        follow them. RoboForm Enterprise is easy to deploy and makes it
        easy for your employees to keep data secure.

        Install AiRoboForm-Enterprise.exe.  After installation make
        sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer
        windows are closed or else the file(s) will not copy over
        properly (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into
        safe mode if you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll and
        roboform-x64.dll (x64 dll is only needed for IE 64bit!) into AI
        Roboform's installed folder, making sure to overwrite the
        existing files.  AI Roboform is now in the full PRO version with
        Enterprise features.
 
        Included is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you
        don't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the
        PolicyEditor folder.
 
        Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when
        you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a
        taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known
        as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.
        In IE 64bit it may show as Desktop ONLY in the about window, but
        if you have chosen Everywhere syncing is still performed
        (hopefully fixed in an update).  Its suggested to use a different
        RoboForm Everywhere password than your master password.  This way
        nobody will be able to decrypt your online database except you.

        Note that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of
        installation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also
        tell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening
        the About window from the taskbar icon, keep this running if you
        want full time syncing with Everywhere.  Everywhere will show
        Sync With [USERNAME], while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can
        be changed at any time by going into Options then User Data and
        clicking on Settings button.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
