       LINUX x64 Version                                                       
                                                                               
       In Exilium is a hack & slash role playing game in the same vein as      
       games like Diablo, yet focuses on minimalism, exploration and           
       discovery as opposed to creating an expansive RPG environment.  It is   
       a simple, exploration driven experience, comprised of action based      
       combat, character attribute customization and random item generation    
       to accommodate many diverse play styles. There are many enemies and     
       bosses to defeat as well as plenty of puzzles to solve and secrets to   
       explore. There is no hand-holding throughout the game, everything       
       must be discovered by the player.                                       
                                                                               
       You play as a king who has been exiled to a strange, hostile world by   
       an unknown force. There are no other characters and no quests to help   
       you along the way. Only through exploration can you learn why you       
       were exiled and how to return

       - Adding Anti Aliasing and VSynch selection in settings                 
       - Adding 32 bit linux build                                             
       - Focus attribute now effects spell damage                              
       - Fixed bug with characters with '_' in their names.                    
       *All characters with '_' have the underscore removed now                
       and it is no longer allowed in character creation*
