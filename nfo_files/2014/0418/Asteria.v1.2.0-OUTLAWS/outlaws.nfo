        Asteria is a fast paced indie platformer, wrapped up in a sandbox      
        sci-fi world where everything is destructible, mineable,               
        collectable, craftable and creatable. You play Ryker: the only         
        surviving human colonist after your people were wiped out by local     
        aliens. Now you’re stranded on Asteria, with no means of escape.       
        This isn’t just about survival, it’s about revenge. Build your safe    
        haven and go track down the aliens who destroyed your colony.          
        It’s a platformer wrapped in a sandbox sandwich                        
                                                                               
        Procedurally generated world maps for unique replays are mixed with    
        handcrafted dungeons to discover and defeat. Throughout Asteria are    
        alien strongholds. Seek these places out to discover treasure,         
        upgrade your equipment and exact your revenge.                         
                                                                               
        In the future, everything is ranged.                                   
                                                                               
        Ranged Mining with more than one block per shot. No more pickaxes.     
        Tunneling is faster, and as you create better mining equipment you     
        can mine faster taking apart huge chunks of terrain in a single        
        shot. Get the mats you need and get back to exploring, building,       
        crafting and creating.                                                 
                                                                               
        Ranged fighting, with blasters. Yes, blasters. No clunky 2D melee      
        fighting, just classic run and gun action.                             
                                                                               
        100+ items over 9 tiers of gear                                        
                                                                               
        Craft new battle suits for more life, new lasers for more damage and   
        better mining tools for faster mining.                                 
                                                                               
        900 Slot “Hypercube of Holding” Inventory with unlimited stack amounts 
                                                                               
        No more item micromanagement. No more bag restrictions. Get your       
        items, keep your items, create your world, and get back to the         
        gameplay. Ever seen a stack of 1 million chunks of dirt? Ryker has.    
                                                                               
        Waypoints & instant deaths for classic platformer gameplay             
                                                                               
        There’s no death penalty and no wandering back to where you died to    
        recollect your inventory. Quick respawns and waypoints are built in    
        so you can get back to the gameplay. Asteria isn’t about inventory     
        management and survival, it’s about exploring and getting back to      
        the action.
