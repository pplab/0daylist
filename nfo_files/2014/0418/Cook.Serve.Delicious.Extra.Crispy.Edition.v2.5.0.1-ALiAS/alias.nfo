     NEW ADDITIONS                                                             
                                                                               
     - EXTREME DIFFICULTY mode added! Start up a new game and you'll get       
       the option of choosing the Standard Difficulty level, or go full        
       blown crazy with the Extreme Difficulty option. This is the most        
       brutal challenge you will likely ever face. Good luck.

       DualShock 4 controllers. All of the menus, foods, everything is         
       controllable via your gamepad, with a brand new opening tutorial as     
       well. Get ready for a crazy new experience!                             
                                                                               
     - (Windows) Rumble is also supported, allowing you to feel the hit        
       of every tenderizer, the sizzle of the deep fryer, the pouring of       
       delicious beer, and lots more. You can toggle this on and off in        
       the new gamepad options menu.                                           
                                                                               
     - New Game+ added! Now you can import your customers served count         
       and achievement progress into a new game with a higher difficulty       
       (Extreme) after achieving Platinum Star status. To activate, make       
       sure you have a Platinum Star save, then start a New Game+ in any       
       empty slot in the save selection menu.                                  
                                                                               
     - New Steam Challenges have also been added! Choose from the Staple

       bonuses awarded for each challenge!                                     
                                                                               
     - A new quick options menu is now available in the opening save           
       slot selection screen. You can now change all graphical/audio           
       options and gamepad toggles before selecting a save slot.               
                                                                               
     - Support for High Rendering (1080p display) has been significantly       
       improved. Recipes text, logos, tutorial splash screens, and lots        
       more have been reworked to be properly displayed at 1080p. You can      
       select High Rendering in the options menu, and you'll need to           
       restart after doing so to apply the changes.                            
                                                                               
     - The opening tutorial can now be replayed in the Gallery/Tutorials

       gamepad controls.                                                       
                                                                               
     - Options menu revamped to include gamepad options, as well as            
       adding a keybinding menu shortcut.

     - Foods that have a consistant recipe (Fried Chicken, Chicken             
       Breast and Beer) now have a different recipe title depending on the     
       star quality.                                                           
                                                                               
     - A handful of confetti will now appear after completing a perfect        
       day, along with some extra notifications and music.

     - Fixed a display error for five star restaurants and above that          
       would improperly mark complete the number of updates needed to          
       progress, as well as the wording on food purchases.                     
                                                                               
     - Fixed bug with friars (Fries) that could allow bad orders even          
       when perfectly completed.

     - Fixed a small bug with robberies.                                       
                                                                               
     - Improved menu UI and displays in many instances.                        
                                                                               
     - Recoded the Practice/Try Out event that would sometimes "gift"          
       the food to the player when trying out a food. The code has been        
       rewritten so that this bug would be totally obliterated.                
                                                                               
     - Fixed glitch that would sometimes cause Extra Events to restart,        
       even after you have successfully beaten it.                             
                                                                               
     - Changed Lettuce to Cabbage in the Soup ingredients because that's       
       what I meant to put and I'm an idiot and I can't believe it took me     
       this long to fix and gahhhhh.                                           
                                                                               
     - Fixed small visual error with dating sim (when dating women, the        
       profile pics on your phone would sometimes be inaccurate).              
                                                                               
     - Fixed glitch when serving fish with lemon when order didn't call        
       for it (keyboard controls).

     - (Beta 2.49 fix) Fixed a glitch that would not display an Extreme        
       Difficulty save file properly when using the Restore Saves feature.     
                                                                               
     Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few       
     in its genre that gives the players total control over where they         
     want to take their restaurant.                                            
                                                                               
     The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda        
     Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as        
     business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the           
     local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum,          
     SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve,           
     Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring         
     it back to its old five star status of world class dining.                
                                                                               
     To do that, youíll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty           
     foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of            
     restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from         
     the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant,       
     and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant          
     packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?      
                                                                               
     And if that werenít enough, youíll also have the opportunity to be        
     cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in       
     SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email        
     account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500             
     emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your                 
     restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via
