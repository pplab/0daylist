  Project Temporality is a third person Action/puzzle game developed around
  streamlining the concept of single player cooperation. You still solve
  problems using multiple clones of yourself, but instead of starting over
  from the beginning or any other fixed position with each clone, you can
  spawn them at any time you like. This removes most of the waiting usually
  associated with synchronizing clones in this kind of games. We also removed
  the frustration of having to replay entire puzzles involving multiple
  timelines by simply allowing you to seamlessly move backwards to any point
  in time.
 
  We do it like this because we want to make it easy for you to perform the
  solution for the puzzle once you have figured it out. No waiting or trial
  and error with timing. To us this is the natural evolution of time based
  gameplay, born out of the frustration of having played puzzles you find the
  solution for in 15 seconds but that still takes a long time to actually
  solve due to not getting the timing perfect.
 
  In Project Temporality you don't have to spawn your clones until you really
  need them. There is, however, a twist. When you spawn a new clone, you lose
  control over the old one and instead assume control of the new. This means
  that you can no longer use any item you picked up before you cloned. In
  other words, you have to be certain that you get the right clone to the
  right place.
 
  You solve puzzles by manipulating elements of the world like doors, force
  fields, lasers, mirrors, elevators or platforms. You control their behavior
  by pressing buttons. Different button-types have different limitations.
  Some elements require you to carry a special item to be able to manipulate
  it. You also need to avoid falling to your death or touching anything
  electrified while avoiding lasers and plasma bullets.
