        What is BayGenie?

        Have you ever lost a bid on eBay because someone else put a
        higher bid at the last seconds? Placing a bid just before the
        auction ends, also known as "sniping", is a strategy a lot of
        eBay bidders use to win an auction.

        BayGenie automatically snipes eBay bids. It is a Windows
        application that automates the process of placing bids on an eBay
        item at the closing time of the auction. With its seamless eBay
        integration, you can login to eBay and search for items using its
        integrated internet browser. Once you've found an item that you
        are interested, you can add it to your watch list and setup how
        long before the end of the auction you want BayGenie to place
        your bid. Then all you have to do is sit back and relax, or do
        whatever you want. BayGenie will automatically place the bid for
        you, even if it's 3am in the morning.

        BayGenie tracks eBay auctions. It also contains an auction
        tracking system that tracks all the items that you are watching,
        bidding, won or lost. It shows important information for each
        item, such as the current highest bidding amount, ending time,
        etc. It also supports multiple users so that different eBay users
        can use the same BayGenie without affecting each other.
