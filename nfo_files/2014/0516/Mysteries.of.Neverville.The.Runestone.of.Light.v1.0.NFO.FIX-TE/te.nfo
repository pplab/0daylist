        NFO FIX:

        Nuke a release because URL isn't updated isn't a reason to nuke
        our rls for wrong nfo, this isn't the movie scene rules, its not
        required.  Future releases will contain NO URLs anymore.


        The runestone of light that has protected the town of Neverville
        for thousands of years is missing. With nothing to protect the
        town, an evil fog has surrounded the people inside. You are the
        daughter of Cygnus Rastlin, the greatest guardian of Neverville
        and must return to the town to stop the evil from spreading. Find
        out who is lurking in the fog! Is it the notorious necromancer
        Grimhall, who was once captured and buried inside a stone chamber
        by Cugnus Rastlin himself. Who is behind the disappearance of the
        runestone! Will you be able to save the innocent people of
        Neverville from their grim fate by restoring the runestone to its
        rightful place?
