  3089 is a futuristic, procedurally generated, open-world action role-playing
  game. All terrain, enemies, weapons, items, quests & more are uniquely
  generated. You are a promising robotic android design, made by the Overlord,
  placed on planet Xax. Your performance in common combat, support & intel
  scenarios is being closely watched. However, will you become too much for
  them to handle? What else on planet Xax exists that the Overlord doesn't
  know about?
