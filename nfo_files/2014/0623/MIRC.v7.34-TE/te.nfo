        mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows
        that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others
        on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group
        conferences or in one-to-one private discussions. 

        It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable
        and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers,
        multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support,
        UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray
        notifications, message logging, and more. 

        mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both
        to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide
        range of functions from network communications to playing games. 

        mIRC has been in development for over a decade and is constantly
        being improved and updated with new technologies. The most recent
        changes can be found on the latest news page. 


        Whats New?

        mIRC 7.34 has been released! (June 18th 2014) 

        This is a small update that addresses a number of issues reported
        by users since the last release. It includes improvements,
        changes and fixes to a number of features, including: 

        ∑ Added a Switchbar font option that allows you to change the
          style and size of font used by the switchbar buttons to improve
          visibility.
        ∑ Fixed SSL certificate password dialog box being displayed
          multiple times when multiple SSL connections are in progress.
        ∑ Added a number of math identifiers such as $atan2(), $hypot()
          and $intersect() that returns the point at which two lines/rays
          intersect.
        ∑ Changed the display size of the toolbar and switchbar buttons
          to make them more usable on tablet touch screens. The small and
          large button size now also apply to the toolbar.
        ∑ Added CAP support for the userhost-in-names and server-time
          server features.
        ∑ Extended SendMessage() support in a number of ways, including
          the ability to disable SendMessage() support in the Lock
          dialog.
        ∑ Changed Clear History feature to retain non-privacy related
          settings, such as interface settings for the treebar,
          switchbar, toolbar and script editor.
        ∑ Extended mouse wheel support to work in interface elements,
          such as list boxes in dialogs, under the cursor even if they
          are not active.
        ∑ Added a $servertarget identifier to return the original address
          specified in the /server command.
        ∑ Improved the way server passwords are stored in servers.ini and
          channels list lock passwords are stored in mirc.ini.
        ∑ Added a $input() 'f' switch that forces the return of
          $no/$cancel for edit/combo boxes.
        ∑ Other changes and bug fixes. 

        In total there have been around 80 changes since the last release
        and although most of them are only small fixes and tweaks, we
        hope that they result in a more useful and stable mIRC for you.

        Install mIRC734.exe.  After installation copy precracked exe from
        the Crack folder to the installed folder of mIRC.  Launch mIRC
        and use ANY information for registration.  You now have a fully
        activated version of mIRC!  This version is also compatible with
        the fish_10.


        IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PORTABLE INSTALL:

        If you choose to make a portable install while doing the
        installation its important to note that the registration info is
        then stored in mIRC.ini on your portable device.  If you copy
        over your mIRC.ini from your Windows Program Files/User
        installation of mIRC, then when you launch mIRC it will ask for a
        key again (if you have entered one before) because this time it
        started to look in your registry.

        Either don't copy your old ini over, or make sure to find, then
        copy and paste the [user] section from the portable version ini
        into your old ini you plan on using.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
