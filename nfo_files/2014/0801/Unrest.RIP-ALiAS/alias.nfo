     Set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India, Unrest is an            
     adventure RPG focused on story and choices. Play as five ordinary         
     people who are struggling to get by in the famine-stricken                
     city-state of Bhimra.                                                     
                                                                               
     Brave poverty, disease, treason, political and social upheaval.           
     Face unique burdens and gripping dilemmas as you struggle to              
     survive in each chapter...but choices made to help one character          
     may well make life harder for another.                                    
                                                                               
     In Unrest, there are no heroes of legend, there is no mystical            
     quest, and fate has not chosen you.                                       
     You're on your own.                                                       
                                                                               
     Features:                                                                 
                                                                               
     - Diverse Characters: Play as a peasant girl faced with an arranged       
       marriage, a priest troubled by his radical temple, a slum dweller       
       with a dangerous past, an ambassador from a militant nation, and a      
       mercenary captain far out of his depth - all as part of the same        
       narrative.                                                              
                                                                               
     - Reactive Storyline: Hard decisions made in one chapter have             
       consequences in the next. A choice made as one character may well       
       determine the fate of another.                                          
                                                                               
     - No Right Answers: There are no fail states in Unrest - if a             
       character dies or fails in their objectives, that becomes part of       
       the narrative. You can play in Iron Man mode to ensure there are no     
       second chances, or save/load if you wish (not that we recommend         
       it).                                                                    
                                                                               
     - Complex Conversations: Unrest's dialogues are organic, branching        
       exchanges designed to offer an unparalleled level of control and        
       involvement to the player. You'll always know exactly what you're       
       saying and how you're saying it, and you'll be able to see how much     
       the person likes, fears, or respects you as a result.                   
                                                                               
     - Violence is Rarely the Answer: Combat in Unrest is rare and always      
       avoidable. When faced with the possibility of death, it's up to you     
       to decide how much you're willing to risk.                              
                                                                               
     - Lush Art & Music: Unrest's hand-drawn sprites and environments          
       call to mind a living canvas, while the classical Indian soundtrack     
       perfectly echoes the narrative's emotional core.
