     Kinetic Void is a 3D space adventure with a focus on customization        
     and exploration. The shipyard allows players to construct their           
     ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a           
     hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each           
     module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen        
     specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems       
     may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between             
     objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an               
     asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with            
     catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in          
     game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around          
     the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to       
     fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro           
     Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of           
     seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there        
     is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to          
     the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and            
     amass wealth, the choices are yours.                                      
                                                                               
     A New Galaxy Every Time.                                                  
                                                                               
     Procedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd        
     like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each        
     sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch.         
     You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try             
     something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your         
     old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to         
     return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well        
     as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative       
     or Career mode.                                                           
                                                                               
     Know Your Neighbors.                                                      
                                                                               
     In Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all          
     factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions          
     interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade,         
     combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based       
     on their own internal standings.                                          
     Fully Detailed and customizable Space Ships.                              
     Tailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky              
     freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your shipís capabilities and              
     appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Voidís ship            
     builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every           
     part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and             
     aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect         
     the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further           
     customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add           
     subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want.           
     Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing           
     ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to          
     your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to         
     see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of           
     making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel.                        
                                                                               
     Freedom to Choose Your Fate.                                              
                                                                               
     Be the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and         
     struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and               
     influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a        
     ëgood guyí? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through         
     sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate           
     stations for supplies as needed.                                          
                                                                               
     Intense Active Combat.                                                    
                                                                               
     Target enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating         
     broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your          
     dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead        
     of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your        
     skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make       
     up your ship.

     Kinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player       
     can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera        
     with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or           
     Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through            
     mouse movements. Control your battleshipís turrets from a sweeping        
     orbital camera or slip between asteroids in a dogfight while              
     piloting your heavy-fighter using mouse flight mode. Switch between       
     modes at any time to best suit the situation.
