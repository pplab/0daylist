     Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few       
     in its genre that gives the players total control over where they         
     want to take their restaurant.                                            
                                                                               
     The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda        
     Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as        
     business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the           
     local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum,          
     SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve,           
     Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring         
     it back to its old five star status of world class dining.                
                                                                               
     To do that, youíll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty           
     foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of            
     restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from         
     the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant,       
     and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant          
     packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?      
                                                                               
     And if that werenít enough, youíll also have the opportunity to be        
     cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in       
     SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email        
     account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500             
     emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your                 
     restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via
