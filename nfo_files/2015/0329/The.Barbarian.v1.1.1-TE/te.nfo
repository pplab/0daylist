        A Top Down Action RPG with an open world storyline. Choose your
        class and over time specialize with dozens of skills and spells.
        You can't get them all, so choose wisely based on your playing
        style. Hundreds of enemy types, hordes to kill. Quests to
        complete, traps to avoid and puzzles to solve. 


        THE GAMEPLAY:
 
        The game is designed for Gamepads, so you can easily move around,
        rotate the camera and do all your actions. However it also works
        with keyboard/mouse. Eventually the game will be released for
        mobile as well. 

        There's over 20 hours of gameplay, and it's highly replayable,
        allowing you to choose different characters, different skills &
        spells, and even completely different paths through the world.
        Will you maximize your character to inflict massive damage? Or
        will you solve the main quest as quickly as possible, cutting
        corners and ignoring less important quests? 

        There's a huge array of weapons and armor to equip, each
        potentially carrying powerful bonus modifications. You'll find
        them in chests throughout the game but also in the towns shops,
        where you can sell what you find and buy new stuff, if you have
        the gold. 

        "Your home has been destroyed by an unknown adversary. You've
        arrived in a strange land..."
