        Super Toy Cars is a tabletop arcade combat racing game featuring
        fast and cool looking cars, impressive tracks made of everyday
        objects and a bunch of power-ups that will let you destroy your
        opposition. Collect all cars and upgrades to keep up with
        competition while you progress in career mode or have a quick
        race either against AI opponents or against friends. You can play
        up to 4 players locally and up to 8 players online. Go and build
        your own tracks, share them with friends or play with them in
        your tracks. Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for
        you to tinkle and play with, but most importantly this game has
        been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either
        alone or with friends. 

        There are 16 different cars in the game each one with its unique
        handling model. You can experiment with them and play the ones
        that best suite your driving style and the different situations
        you'll find in our 12 tracks. Oh, and maybe you'll want to use
        different cars depending on which type of event you're playing,
        because we have 48 events in career mode, but not all of them are
        races! And if you grow tired of the tracks in the game you can
        always check what other tracks have the community built or even
        build your own and share it with our in-game track editor.
