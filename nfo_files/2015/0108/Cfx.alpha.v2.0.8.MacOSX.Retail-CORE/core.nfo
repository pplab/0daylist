€≤    alpha 2.0 brings image composing to a new, unprecedented level.       ≤€
€≤    Take a brief look at the selection of existing and new features,      ≤€
€≤    the screenshots, or visit our website for more information. If you    ≤€
€≤    are a photographer, designer or illustrator we know you'll like       ≤€
€≤    it. A lot.                                                            ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    Not your usual image editor: unlike pixel editors, alpha is a         ≤€
€≤    powerful composition engine. You no longer edit individual pixels     ≤€
€≤    - you are now working with images. alpha's tools are crafted          ≤€
€≤    accordingly, and using them may require you to re-think image         ≤€
€≤    composition. We mean that in a GOOD way. Finally you can compose      ≤€
€≤    images the way you always wanted.                                     ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    alpha 2.0 includes a wide array of professionally designed            ≤€
€≤    templates for 'Composite-' or 'Sed-Cards', Posters, Yearbooks,        ≤€
€≤    Postcards, Collages, etc. Use them to jump-start your own designs.    ≤€
€≤    Of course you can also create your own styles and add them to your    ≤€
€≤    templates at the touch of a button.                                   ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    This is one of alpha's signature features. It allows you to           ≤€
€≤    manipulate transparency like a text editor allows you to edit         ≤€
€≤    words: naturally. Use the built-in transparency managers to           ≤€
€≤    assemble images with complex transparency in real time.               ≤€
€≤    Of course, cf/x alpha also natively supports external blend masks     ≤€
€≤    and transparency if you have them.                                    ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    alpha features more than 80 non-destructive f/x that you can use      ≤€
€≤    to touch-up your source images, or apply to the myriad of             ≤€
€≤    different objects that alpha supports (e.g. text, panels, frames).    ≤€
€≤    All effects are high-quality, fully configurable, stackable,          ≤€
€≤    real-time, and buzzword-compliant.                                    ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    cf/x alpha fully supports text. Unlike most other Apps, alpha lets    ≤€
€≤    you treat text as if it was any other image with complex alpha:       ≤€
€≤    add any f/x or blend to them. Here's something to try: Type some      ≤€
€≤    text, apply the 'Sculpt' effect, then apply the 'Curl' blend to       ≤€
€≤    see the letters first transform into metal, and then lift off in      ≤€
€≤    3D!                                                                   ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    In alpha, image objects are 'Smart' - you can easily exchange the     ≤€
€≤    underlying image, but keep all effects and other properties. They     ≤€
€≤    interact with any other application, allowing you to change images    ≤€
€≤    simply by drag and drop. Image objects no longer need to actually     ≤€
€≤    have an image assigned - even if you add effects and blends to        ≤€
€≤    them.                                                                 ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    alpha's collage generators can create an 'Image Heap', a 'Scatter'    ≤€
€≤    or an Image-'Sweep' and -'Grid' and assemble over 1000 images in a    ≤€
€≤    few seconds - it can also arrange the collage 'by shape'. And of      ≤€
€≤    course it includes the crowd-pleasing advanced Mosaic                 ≤€
€≤    (image-from-images) generator that is so popular that it spawned      ≤€
€≤    it's own App.                                                         ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    Once your composition is completed, render and export it (with        ≤€
€≤    transparency) to different dpi and file formats (PNG, JPG, PDF,       ≤€
€≤    BMP, TIFF, PSD, etc. - quality is only restricted by input            ≤€
€≤    sources).                                                             ≤€
