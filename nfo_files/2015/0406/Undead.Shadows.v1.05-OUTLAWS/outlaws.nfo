        Undead Shadows is a zombie survival FPS that puts the player inside    
        the shoes of a survivor trying to last as long as he can in a zombie   
        infested world. Zombies aren't the only thing the player needs to      
        fear. Giant spiders come out at night from the forests to hunt for     
        live prey! You must survive the never-ending waves of terrifying       
        infected creatures until you are run down, backed into a corner and    
        devoured.                                                              
                                                                               
        As the survivor, you can scour through cities and the country side     
        looking for supplies to help you defend yourself against never         
        ending waves of zombies. The longer you last the harder it gets.       
        Killing zombies and spiders will give you money that can be            
        exchanged for items that will help you survive. There is a weapon      
        store that allows you to upgrade your firepower, a hardware store      
        where you can get supplies to fortify yourself and scattered items     
        to make killing thousands of zombies a bit easier!                     
                                                                               
        Whats new in 1.05                                                      
                                                                               
        I have updated Undead Shadows to 1.0.5 to fix a few issues as well     
        as adding a guest mode that doesn't require registration and doesn't   
        track stats. A full change log is below:

        -Added minidump support to allow more information when crashes occur   
        -Added a bind option to the controls menu for weapon reloading         
        -Added the option for players to play as guests. Stats will not be     
        tracked for players who do not have registered accounts and are not    
        logged in.

        -Updated some sections to account for the new levelEditor that can     
        be installed in any Undead Shadows installation                        
        -Updated the spider AI pathfinding code so they dont get stuck as      
        easily

        -Fixed a bug that caused the prefs.cs file to save in an incorrect     
        location after applying settings
