|                                                                         |
| Blogging and specifically WordPress blogs are one of the most effective |
| ways to generate free traffic these days.                               |
|                                                                         |
| WordPress is a great free platform with a myriad of cool 3rd party      |
| plugins and themes...                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| More importantly Google LOVES WordPress blogs and with very little      |
| effort you can easily rank high and get loads of traffic to your blogs. |
|                                                                         |
| But it can be very hard to convert all that great Google traffic into   |
| actual leads and sales.                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| You see... most of your blog visitors have gone completely "ad blind"   |
|                                                                         |
| They are so used to seeing banner ads, opt-in forms, Adsense and the    |
| like that they have developed the ability to completely ignore them!    |
|                                                                         |
| We all have... and I bet you pay very little attention to for example   |
| banner ads on the blogs you visit online.                               |
|                                                                         |
| It's not all doom and gloom though                                      |
|                                                                         |
| When you have the sort of high quality traffic a blog can generate,     |
| it is easy to convert it into leads, sales and affiliate commissions... |
|                                                                         |
| You just need a fresh approach                                          |
|                                                                         |
| Something your visitors haven't seen before...                          |
|                                                                         |
| This is what is called a "pattern interrupt" and before we continue we  |
| need to take a look at the ultimate pattern interrupt...                |
|                                                                         |
| Skype has arguably become the most used form of direct communication    |
| online.                                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| People LOVE Skype and most of us use it daily to stay in touch with     |
| family, friends and business partners.                                  |
|                                                                         |
| We also live in an age where we are all bombarded with ads and emails   |
| daily...                                                                |
|                                                                         |
| Nothing beats the personal touch of receiving a real card or letter in  |
| the mail... Or even better getting a call and actually talking to a     |
| real human being!                                                       |
|                                                                         |
| That's why when we see an incoming Skype call we ALL drop everything we |
| are doing to answer that call immediately!                              |
|                                                                         |
| When we realised this... the proverbial penny dropped here at the IM    |
| Wealth Builders HQ...                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| We though that if we could build ads that mimic Skype calls, we could   |
| put something on our blogs that would generate more clicks, leads and   |
| sales than ANYTHING else.                                               |
|                                                                         |
| And that is exactly what happened when we started testing our new       |
| plugin.                                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| We're extremely excited and proud to be able to introduce...            |
| The Covert Conversation Plugin                                          |
|                                                                         |
| Covert Conversation is a super simple to use WordPress plugin and it    |
| only takes one click install! That means it will work on any computer,  |
| all you need in order to use it, is a self hosted WordPress blog.       |
|                                                                         |
| Setting up the plugin and configuring your ads is also very easy and    |
| only involves 5 simple steps...                                         |
|                                                                         |
| Step 1: Upload Your Image & Set The Caller Name                         |
| You can upload an image for your Skype ads, or select any image already |
| in your WordPress media library. Then you enter the name you want as    |
| the caller ID on your ads.                                              |
|                                                                         |
| Step 2: Select The Look Of Your Ads                                     |
| You can choose between a normal Skype call or an incoming video call.   |
| And you can set the sound for your ads to be exactly like Skype's       |
| sounds or you can use a generic ring tone.                              |
|                                                                         |
| Step 3: Choose What Happens When The Ad Is Closed                       |
| When people click the red (decline call) button, you can either have it |
| close the ad - or have it open up your desired link (as set in the next |
| step).                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| Step 4: Choose What Happens When People Click On The Ad                 |
| Choose what link you want to send people to when they click the ad.     |
| This can be ANY link you want, including affiliate links and you can    |
| choose to have it open in a new (or the same) window.                   |
| Alternatively you can select to have people automatically call a        |
| pre-defined Skype ID when they click on the ad. This is going to be     |
| extremely powerful for offline businesses, network marketing and other  |
| sites that rely on personal one-on-one selling!                         |
|                                                                         |
| Step 5: Select When & Where To Show The Ad                              |
| You can then select which WordPress pages and posts you want to show    |
| the ad on - and you can even exclude posts from certain categories.     |
|                                                                         |
| And of course you can also set a time delay for when you want the ad    |
| (call) to appear, disappear and reappear.                               |
|                                                                         |
| That's all there is to it!                                              |
|                                                                         |
| And you have up to 5 different ads running on your blog at any given    |
| time and the plugin will automatically rotate between all of them!      |
|                                                                         |
| Do you think people will click on these ads?                            |
|                                                                         |
| You bet they will!                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| And there are 3 simple and very good reasons for this...                |
|                                                                         |
| 1) It's a pattern interrupt - something people are not expecting and    |
|    have not seen before. They will notice your Skype ads.               |
|                                                                         |
| 2) People associate Skype with happy things like talking to family and  |
|    friends. These emotions carry over and makes them want to click your |
|    ads                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| 3) And in a time where we are all bombarded with emails and other       |
|    impersonal types of communication - people love to receive calls and |
|    talk to real people                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| All this combined makes your Skype ads irresistible.                    |
|                                                                         |
| People simply can't and won't ignore them - and they are literally      |
| forced to click on your links.                                          |
|                                                                         |
| And there are so many ways to use Covert Conversation. You can benefit  |
| from using it no matter what niche you are in!                          |
|                                                                         |
| The obvious benefit is the ability to generate insane amounts of clicks |
| to ANY link you want!                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| There are endless possibilities with this plugin and the sky is truly   |
| the limit here.                                                         |
|                                                                         |
| But no matter what you do... Covert Conversation will get you clicks,   |
| it will generate leads and it will make you money!                      |
|                                                                         |
