| Traffic is the lifeblood of any blog.                                   |
|                                                                         |
| You can have the best product or service in the world. You can have a   |
| killer blog that could sell a pint of whisky to a nun. But, if you      |
| don't have any prospects seeing your blog, you won't make a single      |
| cent.                                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| That's why we marketers spend so much time, effort and money trying to  |
| put our blogs and offers in front of targeted leads. But it doesn't     |
| have to be that hard... not when you know which marketing method works  |
| best for driving a lot of traffic.                                      |
|                                                                         |
| Social media has become the most effective way of generating traffic    |
| to your blogs, and there are a few very good reasons for that...        |
|                                                                         |
| Firstly, social signals is quickly becoming one of the most important   |
| factors when Google decides how well your blog should rank.             |
|                                                                         |
| To put it simply... The more people you have sharing your content the   |
| more important you look to Google and the higher they will rank you.    |
|                                                                         |
| But, social sharing is not just important for search engine rankings.   |
|                                                                         |
| When people share and like your content on social networks, their       |
| friends and followers will not only see your link - they get the        |
| chance to share and like it too - making your link go viral and         |
| bringing even more eyeballs to your site.                               |
|                                                                         |
| In fact, chances are that you will get even more traffic directly from  |
| the social sharing sites like Facebook and Tumblr than you will from    |
| the resulting ranking benefit in Google.                                |
|                                                                         |
| Recent studies have also revealed that the majority of internet users   |
| base their online shopping decisions on recommendations they have seen  |
| on social media sites.                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| So, not only will social media bring you more traffic - it will bring   |
| you the right kind of "credit card in hand, I'm ready to buy now"       |
| visitors.                                                               |
|                                                                         |
| Bottom line: getting people to share your blog content on social media  |
| sites is massively important these days!                                |
|                                                                         |
| That is the main problem...                                             |
|                                                                         |
| We all know that getting social shares is important - But getting       |
| people to share your content is very hard...                            |
|                                                                         |
| If your blogs are anything like the average blog out there - that       |
| Facebook like button you put up is likely still sitting there with a    |
| big fat zero on it.                                                     |
|                                                                         |
| And chances are very high that you are not getting the social traffic   |
| you want (or deserve).                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| It's not all doom and gloom though...                                   |
|                                                                         |
| First of all social media has one huge benefit compared to for example  |
| search engine optimization...                                           |
|                                                                         |
| You don't have to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for an       |
| algorithm or other people to do your work for you!                      |
|                                                                         |
| You can easily kick start traffic by sharing your own content on        |
| social media. In fact... Keep reading to see a case study proving how   |
| Covert Viral Wizard can bring in 400 visitors to your blog overnight    |
| using this strategy!                                                    |
|                                                                         |
| But of course the real magic happens when you get other people to       |
| share you content on social media.                                      |
|                                                                         |
| And thankfully that becomes very easy when you discover...              |
|                                                                         |
| Not all content is created equal... Some types of content simply get    |
| more shares than others.                                                |
|                                                                         |
| But don't worry! We're not about to tell you that you need to write     |
| hundreds of pages of unique quality content that would be good enough   |
| to win you a Pulitzer Prize!                                            |
|                                                                         |
| The solution is really easy! All you have to do is log in to your       |
| Facebook account and have a look at your wall.                          |
|                                                                         |
| You will quickly realise that the vast majority of the posts your       |
| friends like, share and comment on are photos and images.               |
|                                                                         |
| And this is universal - in fact 70% of all shared posts on Facebook     |
| are images or photos!                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| But it gets even more interesting when you look at what type of posts   |
| are most likely to go viral on Facebook - 93% of all viral Facebook     |
| posts are images or photos!                                             |
|                                                                         |
| And this is not just on Facebook... The story is the same on all the    |
| social networks!                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| In fact some of the most popular new social networks like Pinterest     |
| and Tumblr are completely image based. And even an old school social    |
| bookmarking site like Digg has turned to an image based format in       |
| order to regain marketshare.                                            |
|                                                                         |
| This is great news for you...                                           |
|                                                                         |
| It means you down have to write endless pages of boring content!        |
|                                                                         |
| In fact since images win the social sharing contest by such a huge      |
| margin - you don't have to write any content at all - to generate huge  |
| amounts of social traffic!                                              |
|                                                                         |
| Facebook is the 800lb gorilla of the social networks and you should     |
| definitely include them in your social media strategy.                  |
|                                                                         |
| Anything else would be insane - and as you will see below the Covert    |
| Viral Wizard theme has everything in place to pull in viral traffic     |
| from Facebook!                                                          |
|                                                                         |
| But Facebook is not the be all end all of social networks.              |
|                                                                         |
| There is tons of traffic to be found on sites like Reddit, Pinterest,   |
| Twitter, LinkedIn & Google plus - and the Covert Viral Wizard theme of  |
| course integrates with all of these!                                    |
|                                                                         |
| We also do a lot of traffic testing when we develop our WordPress       |
| themes - and we have recently found an up and coming social network     |
| that is poised to blow everything else out of the water!                |
|                                                                         |
| Introducing Tumblr.                                                     |
|                                                                         |
| Wait a minute...                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| You may be thinking that Tumblr is free blog host (much like            |
| Wordpress.com) and not a social network!                                |
|                                                                         |
| And while Tumblr is a free blogging platform - it IS also so much more  |
| than that...                                                            |
|                                                                         |
| It's one of the fastest growing social networking sites in the world,   |
| with a young, vibrant and very active user base who loves to share      |
| content.                                                                |
|                                                                         |
| Yahoo recognized the amazing potential of Tumblr... and they purchased  |
| it for a whopping $1.1 billion, making Tumblr founder (and high school  |
| drop out) David Karp America's next tech tycoon.                        |
|                                                                         |
| And one of the things that caught Yahoo's attention...                  |
|                                                                         |
| On average, people spend more time on Tumblr than on Twitter, Pinterest |
| and LinkedIn combined!                                                  |
|                                                                         |
|   * Tumblr is growing faster than ANY other social network out there    |
|   * Tumblr users are younger than the average users on for example      |
|     Facebook. This is great news since big companies are fighting over  |
|     the lucrative under 35 market - and this means much higher ad       |
|     revenue for you!                                                    |
|   * Tumblr users are super active and spend a lot of time on the site   |
|   * 42% of new posts on Tumblr are image/photos. Again this is great    |
|     news since it means you don't have to write a lot, and the users    |
|     are already conditioned to share your images.                       |
|   * The top tag on Tumblr is "GIF" - and animated images (GIFS) are     |
|     the most shared form on content there (hot tip for viral traffic    |
|     right there :)                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| Google also loves Tumblr blogs, making it a very viable way to rank     |
| high and build quality links to your other sites.                       |
|                                                                         |
| But the most compelling reason for using Tumblr is that...              |
|                                                                         |
| Tumblr users LOVE to reblog (share) content. In terms of social         |
| sharing it is the most active social network in the world.              |
|                                                                         |
| In other words... using Tumblr is the easiest way to get your content   |
| shared and generate viral traffic                                       |
|                                                                         |
| However, before you start using Tumblr we have to issue a warning.      |
|                                                                         |
| Firstly Tumblr is not very marketing friendly.                          |
|                                                                         |
| Using Tumblr to build blogs for profit is generally frowned upon by     |
| the community. A Tumblr blog that is obviously used for marketing is    |
| highly unlikely to generate any reblogs, likes or traffic at all.       |
|                                                                         |
| A Tumblr blog that has ads and links on it also runs a very real risk   |
| of getting deleted outright - in which case you will loose all your     |
| links and content - not to mention the wasted time.                     |
|                                                                         |
| Secondly, you never want to put all of your eggs into one basket...     |
| Especially not a basket you don't control completely yourself. Who      |
| knows what Tumblr will do in the future and what happens to your        |
| content and all the hours you have put in then?                         |
|                                                                         |
| So while we recommend that you start using Tumblr - we don't recommend  |
| that you use it as your main blogging and content platform.             |
|                                                                         |
| But don't worry...                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| We saw that using Tumblr was very beneficial - but also problematic at  |
| best - especially the fact that it is hard to monetize, and we are in   |
| internet marketing to make money after all - right?                     |
|                                                                         |
| So we set out to create a solution to this problem...                   |
|                                                                         |
| As you may know... we are huge fans of WordPress. Not only is WP both   |
| easy and free to use... Google also loves the WP platform so it's       |
| great for SEO and getting free traffic too.                             |
|                                                                         |
| And that's when it hit us...                                            |
|                                                                         |
| Tumblr and WordPress go hand in hand... And it would benefit all        |
| WordPress bloggers to have a Tumblr blog too.                           |
|                                                                         |
| Why don't we combine the two? Make a WordPress theme that mimics        |
| Tumblr to bring you all the benefits to your own site - while at the    |
| same time integrating with and sucking traffic and backlinks from       |
| Tumblr, Facebook and all the other social networks on auto pilot?       |
|                                                                         |
| Plus with 4 previous best selling WP themes under our belt it made      |
| sense for us to pull on that experience and incorporate the best        |
| features from our previous work too.                                    |
|                                                                         |
| So we got to work on creating a WordPress theme so powerful it would    |
| rival Tumblr itself, while being so easy to operate that my own mum     |
| could do it (and she calls me and freaks out every time she receives a  |
| spam email - sorry mum lol)                                             |
|                                                                         |
| It took many months... we spent countless hours coding, testing,        |
| tweaking and perfecting this theme.                                     |
|                                                                         |
| But I'm very glad we persevered - because the end result is by far out  |
| best and most advanced WordPress theme to date... In fact it's most     |
| likely the most powerful & easy to use theme you have ever seen!        |
|                                                                         |
| And we are extremely proud to be able to introduce...                   |
|                                                                         |
|                     The Covert Viral Wizard Theme                       |
|                                                                         |
| Covert Viral Wizard is a super simple to use WordPress theme and it     |
| only takes one click to install! That means it will work on any         |
| computer, all you need in order to use it, is a self hosted WordPress   |
| blog.                                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| The theme is designed to mimic Tumblr to tap into the familiarity,      |
| loyalty and conditioning they have already built.                       |
|                                                                         |
| Covert Viral Wizard looks like a mix between the Tumblr dashboard and   |
| the hugely popular redux theme for Tumblr.                              |
|                                                                         |
| But of course we built in the option to customize anything you want...  |
|                                                                         |
| Now what happens when people visit this site?                           |
|                                                                         |
| First of all the site looks good and it presents what people like to    |
| share (images) in the way they like to share them                       |
|                                                                         |
| But there is some even more powerful stuff going on here...             |
|                                                                         |
| For any Tumblr user, everything on your site will be instantly          |
| familiar to them...                                                     |
|                                                                         |
| In fact most of them will think they are on Tumblr - instead of on      |
| your WordPress blog.                                                    |
|                                                                         |
| We already know what Tumblr users like to do...                         |
|                                                                         |
| The love to follow, like and reblog!                                    |
|                                                                         |
| And on each of your posts they will see the familiar Tumblr reblog and  |
| like icons                                                              |
|                                                                         |
| When they click reblog they will instantly reblog your post to their    |
| own Tumblr blog - netting you high quality social back links and        |
| traffic on auto pilot!                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| And when they click the "heart" button - they will actually like your   |
| post on Facebook.                                                       |
|                                                                         |
| This happens entirely in the background and posts your image, text and  |
| most importantly your link on their Facebook wall for ALL their         |
| friends to see. In our test this has proven to be a massive viral       |
| traffic generator!                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| On the sidebar they will also find the "Follow on Tumblr" button -      |
| when they click this they will follow any Tumblr blog you want them     |
| to.                                                                     |
|                                                                         |
| There is also some more Tumblr magic on the sidebar, including...       |
|                                                                         |
| The "Random" link - each time they click this they will go to a random  |
| post on your blog (again is this is very familiar and often used by     |
| Tumblrs).                                                               |
|                                                                         |
| And there is the archive page which also looks exactly like on Tumblr   |
| - and that's a lot better than standard WordPress!                      |
|                                                                         |
| The theme also has infinite scrolling - just like the Tumblr dashboard  |
| does...                                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| And the best part...                                                    |
|                                                                         |
| We've have already discussed how images are the most shared form of     |
| content on social networks.                                             |
|                                                                         |
| And in true Tumblr style, the Covert Viral Wizard theme has been        |
| designed to capitalize on this.                                         |
|                                                                         |
| All you have to do post interesting images and photos - or videos as    |
| the theme works really well with Youtube videos too!                    |
|                                                                         |
| Then you write a title for the post and an optional description for     |
| the image.                                                              |
|                                                                         |
| That's all you need... Gone are the days of writing page after page of  |
| boring articles that nobody wants to read anyway!                       |
|                                                                         |
| Yet you will still be generating more traffic than ever before.         |
|                                                                         |
| Because, not only will Covert Viral Wizard harvest traffic and links    |
| from Tumblr......                                                       |
|                                                                         |
| Everyone who visits your blog can also share your posts on Facebook,    |
| Twitter, Pinterest, Reddit, LinkedIn and Google+                        |
|                                                                         |
| And finally... We've saved the best bit for last!                       |
|                                                                         |
| The Covert Viral Wizard theme lets your visitors comment on your posts  |
| using Facebook comments!                                                |
|                                                                         |
| Not only will this result in more comments and social engagement from   |
| your users - because they are familiar with Facebook comments and love  |
| to use them                                                             |
|                                                                         |
| It will also result in free links and loads of viral traffic to your    |
| blogs.                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| Because every time someone comments on a post on your blog - it will    |
| be posted on their Facebook wall complete with a link back to your      |
| site!                                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| And if people comment on that Facebook post, the comment will also      |
| automatically be added to your blog!                                    |
|                                                                         |
| Getting people to share and comment on your posts is easy...            |
|                                                                         |
| Especially when you post images and videos - the #1 thing people like   |
| to comment on and share on Facebook.                                    |
|                                                                         |
| That's the beauty on focusing on social traffic...                      |
|                                                                         |
| You don't have to sit around twiddling your thumbs, waiting for an      |
| algorithm or other people to send you traffic.                          |
|                                                                         |
| After adding your first post to the theme you can share it on social    |
| networks yourself, to kickstart the traffic.                            |
|                                                                         |
| We did just that on our test blog... After adding the first post we     |
| reblogged it to Tumblr and shared in on Reddit.                         |
|                                                                         |
| We went from zero to 350 visitors overnight!                            |
|                                                                         |
| And this was done using two brand new Tumblr and Reddit accounts with   |
| absolutely zero history or followers - in other words you can do the    |
| exact same thing!                                                       |
|                                                                         |
| Even if you just posted one image per day and shared it on a few        |
| networks...                                                             |
|                                                                         |
| Your traffic will quickly snowball!                                     |
|                                                                         |
| Turning your Covert Viral Wizard sites in to a money magnet!            |
|                                                                         |
| The theme comes with 5 widget ready areas - including sidebars for all  |
| posts and pages and footer.                                             |
|                                                                         |
| Use these to add any WP widgets, ads, optin forms etc...                |
|                                                                         |
| Covert Viral Wizard also has inbuilt theme ads.                         |
|                                                                         |
| You can use these for anything you want, including banners, Google      |
| Adsense, Amazon widgets, custom HTML etc.                               |
|                                                                         |
| Simply configure how many different ads you want to display and where   |
| - then put in the code for your ads...                                  |
|                                                                         |
| The ads will then automatically be inserted at the bottom of each of    |
| your posts.                                                             |
|                                                                         |
| If you set up more than one ad (you can have 5 in total) they will be   |
| randomly rotated.                                                       |
|                                                                         |
| You can even set the ads to appear on the front page of your blog too.  |
|                                                                         |

| We have designed the plugin to be as easy and fast to use as possible.  |
|                                                                         |

| Viral Wizard theme, the posts it produces will always look great on     |
| your blogs.                                                             |
|                                                                         |
| First of all Covert Content Wizard is a super simple to use and         |
| install (1 click install) WordPress plugin. That means the software     |
| will work on any computer, all you need in order to use it, is a self   |
| hosted WordPress blog.                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| And because it's designed to work with your Covert Viral Wizard theme   |
| there is no fiddling with templates, css or any techy stuff - it works  |
| right out of the box!                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| After you have installed and activated the plug in (only takes a few    |
| seconds) you will reach a page, where you set up the main setting for   |
| your autoblogging campaign (and you only have to to this once)          |
|                                                                         |
| Enter they keywords you want to use for auto-blogging campaign. You     |
| can add as many keywords or phrases as you want! You can even put them  |
| in "quotes" for exact match.                                            |
|                                                                         |
| Select if your new auto blogged posts should be published immediately   |
| or saved as drafts for you to edit before posting.                      |
|                                                                         |
| Have the plugin automatically create tags for your post based on the    |
| title of the source content.                                            |
|                                                                         |
| You can even import comments to add SEO friendly content and social     |
| proof to your viral blogs - increasing both traffic and conversions!    |
|                                                                         |
| Now it's time to configure one or more of the content modules.          |
|                                                                         |
| For this example I'm going to use the Tumblr module - but they are all  |
| really simple to set up and you can have them all running within        |
| minutes!                                                                |
|                                                                         |
| You simply select which Tumblr blog you want to use for this campaign   |
| - this can be any Tumblr blog, not just your own.                       |
|                                                                         |
| Notice that you can select which of your keywords to use and only auto  |
| blog posts matching those keywords - or you can select to not use any   |
| keywords (to pull in from all posts on this Tumblr blog).               |
|                                                                         |
| Then you select which of you blog's categories your autoblogged post    |
| from this Tumblr campaign should be posted under.                       |
|                                                                         |
| And voila!                                                              |
|                                                                         |
| You are now ready to turn auto blogging on - and from now on the        |
| Covert Content Wizard plugin will keep posting to your blog store       |
| using the settings you have specified.                                  |
|                                                                         |
| That was just one Tumblr feed - for one Tumblr blog...                  |
|                                                                         |
| You can create as many Tumblr feeds - for as many keywords and Tumblr   |
| blogs as you like!                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| You could literally be pulling in hundreds of unique posts hour if you  |
| wanted to!                                                              |
|                                                                         |
