| The economy has been tanking since 2008 and every single day we get     |
| reminded about it with our daily dose of bad news from around the       |
| world... Fiscal cliffs in the US, Eurozone Crisis, mass unemployment    |
| etc.                                                                    |
|                                                                         |
| But amidst declining consumer confidence and stagnating retail sales... |
| One industry is actually bucking the trend and growing very fast...     |
|                                                                         |
| eCommerce and online retail is blooming, and every day more and more    |
| people choose to do their shopping online.                              |
|                                                                         |
| Amazon is of course the 800lb gorilla in online retail.                 |
|                                                                         |
| And even though Amazon is big... they are only one player in a huge     |
| market worth over $1 trillion a year and growing fast!                  |
|                                                                         |
| Most of the big online retail networks, Amazon included, have affiliate |
| programs. They will pay you a % of every order placed by visitors you   |
| send to them through your affiliate links.                              |
|                                                                         |
| Now you may have looked at for example Amazon's affiliate program       |
| before and thought to yourself that it did not seem very interesting... |
| after all they only pay between 4% to 10% commissions right?            |
|                                                                         |
| I know this may sound weird... but this is actually better than your    |
| usual run of the mill digital info product offering 50%, 75% or maybe   |
| even 100% commissions!                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| The reason...                                                           |
|                                                                         |
| Unlike most info products... A site like Amazon has products that       |
| EVERYONE both want and need. Nowadays you could actually live your      |
| entire life only shopping from Amazon.                                  |
|                                                                         |
| No matter what your audience is - you would be able to sell them        |
| something from Amazon or similar sites.                                 |
|                                                                         |
| Amazon is also the uncrowned king of upsells - they are extremely good  |
| at getting people to buy more than one item at a time - and those 4-10% |
| commissions rack up fast!                                               |
|                                                                         |
| They have the "these items are frequently purchased together" thing     |
| going, not to mention the minimum order required to qualify for free    |
| shipping.                                                               |
|                                                                         |
| Bottom line... all the big super affiliates already know that selling   |
| physical products from sites like Amazon is the secret key to earning   |
| the big affiliate paychecks!                                            |
|                                                                         |
| So how do you get started on this?                                      |
|                                                                         |
| Plenty of more or less ethical marketers have released so called Amazon |
| affiliate themes over the last couple of years... Understandable since  |
| Amazon is a buzz word and that means loads of potential buyers for good |
| affiliate themes                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| Unfortunately the hype was seldom justified.                            |
|                                                                         |
| Earning the big affiliate paychecks, takes a lot more than just         |
| displaying some auto blogged Amazon products in a grid!                 |
|                                                                         |
| And odds are pretty good that you have a few of these "Azon" this or    |
| "Zon" that themes, collecting virtual dust on your hard drive... And    |
| the only commission they have ever generated was the one for the        |
| affiliate who recommended them to you!                                  |
|                                                                         |
| But if we already know what doesn't work - then surely we also know     |
| what does...                                                            |
|                                                                         |
| At the start of 2013 we began researching all the biggest eCommerce and |
| affiliate stores out there... looking for common traits that would      |
| explain their success.                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| We ended up with an impressive feature list and then went about         |
| creating the ultimate affiliate store platform, incorporating all these |
| common traits.                                                          |
|                                                                         |
| And as you may know... we are huge fans of WordPress. Not only is WP    |
| both easy and free to use... Google also loves the WP platform so it's  |
| great for SEO and getting free traffic too.                             |
|                                                                         |
| Plus with 3 previous best selling WP themes under our belt it made      |
| sense for us to pull on that experience and incorporate the best        |
| features from our previous work too.                                    |
|                                                                         |
| 6 months of grueling development and testing later... We are 100%       |
| confident that we have succeeded in creating the ultimate affiliate     |
| store builder.                                                          |
|                                                                         |
| And we are extremely proud to be able to introduce...                   |
|                                                                         |
| The Covert Store Builder Theme                                          |
|                                                                         |
| Covert Store Builder is a super simple to use WordPress theme and it    |
| only takes one click install! That means it will work on any computer,  |
| all you need in order to use it, is a self hosted WordPress blog.       |
|                                                                         |
| You can use the Covert Store Builder to build affiliate stores in ANY   |
| niche you want!                                                         |
|                                                                         |
| ... including single niches or a big store covering multiple niches     |
| like for example Amazon itself does.                                    |
|                                                                         |
| The store includes products and content imported straight from Amazon   |
| and other affiliate networks...                                         |
|                                                                         |
| We built in the option to customize anything you want... all the        |
| options are on one simple page and can be changed with just a few       |
| clicks of your mouse!                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| A few of the settings you can easily change from the "Theme Options"    |
| page include:                                                           |
|                                                                         |
| - Setting a custom header or background image (or color)                |
| - Edit any color anywhere on your blog, with a simple point & click     |
|   color selector tool                                                   |
| - Turn the widget ready sidebars on/off for all your pages and posts    |
|   (show them to the left or right)                                      |
| - Change the text on all your menus, categories, buttons etc.           |
| - Select how to order your posts on the front page - exclude/include    |
|   posts and categories                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| And this even includes 5 premade templates. You simply click on one of  |
| them and all the color settings in your theme will automatically        |
| change.                                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| This is the easiest way to change the look of an entire theme you have  |
| ever seen!                                                              |
|                                                                         |
| But that's just the look - the real power lies in what this theme can   |
| do!                                                                     |
|                                                                         |
| Straight out of the box - the Covert Store Builder theme comes with all |
| the functionality of the big ecommerce sites.                           |
|                                                                         |
| - Your visitors can browse your sites and search for products they like |
| - They can join your site as members and they will automatically be     |
|   added to your autoresponder!                                          |
| - They can add products to their wish list for later and even share     |
|   their wish list with their friends!                                   |
| - Covert Store Builder is self optimizing, automatically showing the    |
|   most popular products first - maximizing your profits!                |
| - And much more...                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| And this is NOT some fake theme that imitates a real eCommerce site...  |
|                                                                         |
| We've stretched WordPress to the limit... and then some!                |
|                                                                         |
| Adding products to your new store could not be any easier...            |
|                                                                         |
| You simply choose what keyword to search for on which networks (and how |
| many results you want to get)                                           |
|                                                                         |
| The theme then gives you a list of products, with all the details you   |
| need.                                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| All you have to do is check the box next to the products you want to    |
| import - select which category to import too - and whether you want to  |
| import as drafts (for later editing/publishing) or as posts that go     |
| live immediately.                                                       |

| You can literally fill your new store with great selling products in    |
| mere minutes... Without ever having to write a single word!             |
|                                                                         |
| After you have added some products, the real power of the theme kicks   |
| in...                                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| No more guessing what will convert best to your visitors.               |
|                                                                         |
| The theme will track impressions and clicks for every single product    |
| in your store...                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| And by default it will automatically show the most popular products at  |
| the top of your store!                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| This feature will continuously maximize your conversion rates and       |
| profits on complete autopilot!                                          |
|                                                                         |
| This is not only for the home page either... you can choose to show     |
| only your best converting products in the featured products rotator at  |
| the top of your page.                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| ... instantly increase your sales and conversions by showing your       |
| visitors exactly what they are most likely to buy, as the first thing   |
| they see when they visit your site!                                     |
|                                                                         |
| When your visitors click the "+ Add To Wish List" links they will be    |
| asked to login - and if they haven't signed up yet they can easily do   |
| so from the sexy lightbox pop-up join form.                             |
|                                                                         |
| And since the wish list function is very handy and a large chunk of     |
| your visitors will join your site in order to enhance their shopping    |
| experience...                                                           |
|                                                                         |
| They can then bookmark products they like for later shopping...         |
|                                                                         |
| Not only will this increase your conversion rates... It will also help  |
| ensure that your visitors return to shop at your store over and over    |
| again!                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| But the real magic happens when your members start sharing their wish   |
| lists with their friends.                                               |
|                                                                         |
| Your visitors can build a wish list, for example for X-mas, birthdays,  |
| weddings etc. and then share it with their friends on social media or   |
| via email.                                                              |
|                                                                         |
| Their friends will then land on a page...                               |
|                                                                         |
| Making it super easy for them to buy gifts for their friend... and of   |
| course you will earn a commission every time they do so!                |
|                                                                         |
| But even better...                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| The wish list will have your members automatically generating traffic,  |
| sales and new customers for you, every time they use the feature!       |
|                                                                         |
| And that's not even the best part!                                      |
|                                                                         |
| When someone joins your site, Covert Store Builder can automatically    |
| send them a welcome email - and you can fully customize that email.     |
|                                                                         |
| Including a part where you can promote a product from your store, or    |
| something else related to your niche.                                   |
|                                                                         |
| And with just a single click you can manually export all your members   |
| as leads!                                                               |
|                                                                         |
| The export generates a handy .csv file which is exactly what you need   |
| to easily add them to any autoreponder service like for example Aweber  |
| and GetResponse.                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| But we took it one step further... and custom coded something I have    |
| never seen in any other WordPress theme!                                |
|                                                                         |
| Yes, with a super simple setup that's fully integrated with all the     |
| big auto responders (and works will all the others too)...              |
|                                                                         |
| ...You can automatically and instantly add ALL your members to your     |
| autoresponder list of choice!                                           |
|                                                                         |
| This way you can email them whenever you want - keep them coming back   |
| to your store and/or sell products to them directly.                    |
|                                                                         |
| People always say that "the money is in the list!"... and that's 100%   |
| true.                                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| And with Covert Store Builder you will automatically build a list of    |
| customers... and since they signed up to join your store you know       |
| exactly what they are interested in buying!                             |
|                                                                         |
| Being able to sell to the same people again and again - without extra   |
| effort or cost - is the secret key to super affiliate success.          |
|                                                                         |
| And not only will you make money every time one of your visitors or     |
| members buy one of the products you have added to your store.           |
|                                                                         |
| The theme comes with 8 widget ready areas - including sidebars for all  |
| posts and pages and footer.                                             |
|                                                                         |
| Use these to add any WP widgets, ads, optin forms etc... Including      |
| two custom inbuilt widgets that will help you make even more affiliate  |
| sales!                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| Covert Store Builder also has inbuilt theme ads.                        |
|                                                                         |
| You can use these for anything you want, including for example Google   |
| Adsense.                                                                |
|                                                                         |
| Simply configure how many ads you want to display and where - then put  |
| in the code for your ads...                                             |
|                                                                         |
| And your ads will show up in between the product listings in your       |
| store... ready to make you even more money!                             |
|                                                                         |
| As you can see we have thought about everything for Covert Store        |
| Builder.                                                                |
|                                                                         |
| You stores will get members!                                            |
|                                                                         |
| You will build a list!                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| And you will make sales & earn money!                                   |
|                                                                         |
| There's only one component missing... in order to kickstart all this    |
| your stores of course need traffic.                                     |
|                                                                         |
| But don't worry we have that covered too!                               |
|                                                                         |
| On top of the automatic social traffic the wish list function will      |
| generate for your store...                                              |
|                                                                         |
| Both you and your members... and indeed anyone who visits your Covert   |
| Store Builder sites can share your posts on Facebook, Twitter,          |
| Pinterest, Google+ & LinkedIn!                                          |
|                                                                         |
| From the front page they can also click to follow you on all the        |
| social networks or subscribe to your RSS feed - giving you another way  |
| to reach your customers over and over again...                          |
|                                                                         |
| And finally... We've saved the best bit for last!                       |
|                                                                         |
| The Covert Store Builder theme lets your visitors comment on your post  |
| using Facebook comments!                                                |
|                                                                         |
| Not only will this result in more comments and social engagement from   |
| your users - because they are familiar with Facebook comments and love  |
| to use them                                                             |
|                                                                         |
| It will also result in free links and loads of viral traffic to your    |
| store.                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| Because every time someone comments on a product in your store - the    |
| product will be posted on their Facebook wall complete with a link      |
| back to your store!                                                     |
|                                                                         |
| If people comment on that Facebook post, the comment will also          |
| automatically be added to your store!                                   |
|                                                                         |
| Getting people to share and comment on the products in your store is    |
| easy...                                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| Especially if you build niche stores that center around a single topic. |
|                                                                         |
| It's much easier to get people to engage when they are interested in    |
| everything in your store - as opposed to only a few items.              |

|                                                                         |
| And because it's designed to work with your Covert Store Builder theme  |
| there is no fiddling with templates, css or any techy stuff - it works  |
| right out of the box!                                                   |

|                                                                         |
| Select if your new auto blogged posts should be published immediately   |

|                                                                         |

|                                                                         |

| First, configure at least one of the supported affiliate networks.      |
|                                                                         |

|                                                                         |
| So, if you're using Amazon, you simply select which of your keywords    |
| you want to use for the campaign.                                       |
|                                                                         |
| You can select which Amazon category you want to use - the plugin       |
| supports all Amazon cetegories! - and you can also set at min/max price |
| range for the products you want to import.                              |
|                                                                         |
| Then you select which of you blog's categories your autoblogged post    |
| from this Amazon campaign should be posted under.                       |
|                                                                         |
| And voila!                                                              |
|                                                                         |

| Covert Store Content plugin will keep posting products to your          |
| affiliate store using the settings you have specified.                  |
|                                                                         |
| That was just one Amazon feed - for one keyword...                      |
|                                                                         |

|                                                                         |

|                                                                         |

|                                                                         |
| Amazon, Commission Junction & eBay!                                     |
|                                                                         |

| all 3 of them!                                                          |
|                                                                         |

| Then whenever the Covert Store Content autoblogs a new product to your  |
| affiliate store... It will also automatically post on Facebook and      |
| Twitter announcing the product!                                         |

| And you can customize the message to anything you like...               |
|                                                                         |
