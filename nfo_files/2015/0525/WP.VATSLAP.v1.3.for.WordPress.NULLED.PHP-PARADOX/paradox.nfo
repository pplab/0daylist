|                                                                         |
| The Problem:                                                            |
|                                                                         |
| In January of 2015 the EUC forced everyone that sells products online   |
| to collect and report VAT tax on sales made to customers covered in the |
| 27 EU countries.                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| This caused a lot of online vendors in the US (and other countries) to  |
| have to register with the VATMOSS and start collecting and reporting    |
| these sales.                                                            |
|                                                                         |
| This caused a lot of online vendors to cut off sales to customers from  |
| these countries and some vendors closed down shop altogether!           |
|                                                                         |
| But It Doesn't Have To Be This Way...Here's Why                         |
|                                                                         |
| Possible Solution:                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| Many of the afiliate marketplaces like JVZoo, Zaaxa and a few others    |
| adapted their payment gateway systems to generating reports of these    |
| sales and even allowed you to block the sales that would require you to |
| collect VAT tax...although that helps but it's still no real solution!  |
|                                                                         |
| You either have to still deal with the collection and reporting of the  |
| sales and the VAT taxes OR turn away customers if you decide to block   |
| the sales altogether!                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| The Real Solution:                                                      |
|                                                                         |
| Redirect these customers to an alternative payment system that will     |
| deal with the EU VAT for you --- such as Clickbank!                     |
|                                                                         |
| Why Clickbank?                                                          |
|                                                                         |
| Because Clickbank Acts As The "Middle Man" In All The Sales Of          |
| Products In Their Marketplace... Meaning That THEY Are The One Making   |
| The Sale So It's Up To Them To Deal With VAT Collection & Reporting --  |
| It Doesn't Get Any Sweeter Than That!                                   |
|                                                                         |
| The Process Is Simple!                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| 1) Create 2 payment buttons: a payment button from PayPal, or any       |
| payment system that uses PayPal such as JVZoo, Warrior+, DigiResults    |
| or Zaxxa, and then anoher payment button for Clickbank.                 |
|                                                                         |
| 2) Add a WP-VATSLAP shortcode to any WordPress post/page...and that's   |
| it! Then if a visitor arrives to your page from a country where a       |
| sale would normally involve charging VAT on a purchase WP-VATSLAP       |
| will show them the Clickbank payment button...otherwise WP-VATSLAP      |
| will show your regular JVZoo, Warrior+ (or whatever payment procesor    |
| you choose) button instead.                                             |
|                                                                         |
| WP-VATSLAP Works With All The Major Payment Processors!                 |
|                                                                         |
| As Long As You Can Create A Payment Button Code And Place It On Your    |
| Website WP-VATSLAP Will Work.                                           |
|                                                                         |
| - Automatic Detection Of EU VAT Required Countries (Includes An         |

| But Wait There's One More Feature We Haven't Even Told You About...     |
|                                                                         |

| Clickbank In An Emergency!                                              |
|                                                                         |
| It Happens Everyday, Just Out Of The Blue Paypal Can Choose To Place A  |
| Temporary Limitation On Your Account Until You Call Them And Work       |
| Things Out With Them (Usually Verifying Your Business Info). But This   |
| Can Take Hours Or Even Days!                                            |
|                                                                         |
