| Are you sick and tired of manually optimizing your onsite content?      |
|                                                                         |
| If so, then I know exactly how you feel, if you manage to build or have |
| a site built for you chances are you are familiar with SEO.             |
| Specifically Onpage and Onsite SEO. And you also know how TEDIOUS the   |
| process can be to optimize each post and page for your key-words...     |
|                                                                         |
| There's nothing more disappointing than having spent months (even       |
| years) creating and refining a website, product, or brand that you      |
| think will help people, only to then put it up online and not have any  |
| web traffic or sales...                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| This is what happens when you neglect Onsite SEO!                       |
|                                                                         |
| Until now the only way to reverse this situation and get your website   |
| ranking and your sales growing has been to hire an experienced SEO or   |
| Marketing Consultant to review your site, and put together a tailored   |
| plan to help your onsite strategy,                                      |
|                                                                         |
| OR whats worse you have to PAINSTAIKINGLY learn Onsite SEO and then     |
| MANUALLY apply what you have learned on each page and post of your      |
| site...                                                                 |
|                                                                         |
| The problem with this option is that expert SEOs and Digital Marketers  |
| are hard to find, and even if you do manage to find one willing to      |
| help you out you'll be looking at up-wards of $500 per hour or some     |
| crappy service that you end up regretting. Both sound like a waste to   |
| me!!!                                                                   |

| That's why today, I'm delighted to share with you my brand new website  |
| optimization tool called "SEO Monster" that is capable of boosting your |
| search rankings and SALES OVERNIGHT. I know that may sound              |
