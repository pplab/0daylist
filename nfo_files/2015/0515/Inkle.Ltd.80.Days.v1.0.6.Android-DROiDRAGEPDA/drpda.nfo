  Featuring stunning art by Jaume Illustration, a
  half-million word script by Meg Jayanth, original music by
  Laurence Chapman, and built using the same inklewriter
  engine that powers our critically-acclaimed Sorcery!
  series, 80 DAYS is an interactive adventure created by your
  choices, on the fly, and is different every time you play.

  Playing as Phileas Fogg's loyal valet, Passepartout, you
  must balance your master's health, your finances, and the
  time, as you choose your own path from city to city all the
  way around the world. Bribe your way onto early departures,
  but don't let yourself go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping
  rough and begging for aid! Trade items for profit, and
  collect the equipment for the conditions you'll face: but
  too much luggage will slow you down...

  80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that
  never stops running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons,
  boats, camels, horses and more leave and arrive minute by
  minute.

  Every city and journey is narrated via an interactive story
  where you control every action. Will your choices speed you
  up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust
  and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts
  that can shave days off your time? Murder, romance,
  rebellion and intrigue await!

  The app is network-connected, with a live feed that shows
  you the position of all the other players of the game,
  their routes, triumphs and disasters. You can race to be
  the fastest - or look ahead to learn the secrets of the
  world.

  Share your own journey with friends, and load other's
  routes directly into your app so you can race head-to-head.
