  Do you dare to control the wizard in all his adventures in
  this game?

  "Adventures of a Wizard" is an elegant combination of a
  fairy-tale and an action story in this new platformer game.

  This story happened on an island situated somewhere in the
  Mythical Ocean. The island was populated by sapient
  creatures of different kind, and this part of land had its
  own purpose. What purpose? Oh, but have patience!

  Somewhere deep in a cave, there was a castle where a Wizard
  resided. No-one knows for sure who had built the castle and
  who lived there in the distant past. But let’s get back to
  our Wizard.

  The Wizard talked to no-one, so nobody knew what the young
  mage occupies himself with. Actually, he occupied himself
  with astronomy, alchemy, and magic arts. By reading elfin
  books, the Wizard was perfecting his knowledge, until one
  day…

  It happened when the Wizard inadvertently summoned a Demon
  from the shadowy otherworld. The Demon promised the Wizard
  unlimited opportunities and magic skills and Wizard became
  a medium of the Demon’s evil will without realizing it
  himself.

  Since then, the Wizard’s soul divided in two – one part
  obeyed demon implicitly, and the other, on the contrary,
  retained some of the light that used to exist in the young
  wizard’s life.

  Legend of the stars.
  As one ancient legend says, the stars have been given to
  people as a gift from pagan gods. The stars were not only
  the sources of light in the night-time, but also a
  safeguard against the intrusion of demons from the shadowy
  world. It used to be thought of as a mere legend, a
  fairy-tale to scare naughty children. “If you misbehave,
  the demons will come and whisk you away” – the islanders
  would say.

  Cowardly knight.
  Once upon a time, some knights came to the island in search
  of treasures and intending to start a colony. But the
  intruders did not expect to encounter resistance. Oh, the
  distant battles of the past… Some have fallen here, others
  managed to escape from the island. Peter the Knight was one
  of those who stayed. A small man in a tarnished armor, he
  was afraid of just about everything. He would have remained
  unknown, hiding away in the thick of the forest, if he
  hadn’t met the Wizard one day.

  The last of the elves.
  The first species to populate the island were elves – tall,
  with razor-sharp ears. Having suffered casualties in the
  battle with the colonizing knights, elves sunk into
  oblivion. Some people say that somewhere beyond the hills
  an old elf still lives – the only one who has survived
  since those days long while ago. … Knowing of the purpose
  of stars and how they influence all that is alive, the
  Demon conceived an insidious plan. He promised the young
  Wizard a mastership over the word, if he collects all stars
  and helps letting frightful creatures out of the shadowy
  world. That’s how the end of the world was supposed to
  start when everything green and blooming would turn to
  chaos.
