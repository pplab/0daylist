  The world's most devilishly addictive defense game is back
  - welcome to Kingdom Rush: Frontiers!

  Bigger and badder than ever before, Kingdom Rush: Frontiers
  is a whole new level of the furiously fast, enchantingly
  charming gameplay that made the original title an
  award-winning hit. Tap your troops through an epic
  (mis)adventure as you defend exotic lands from dragons,
  man-eating plants, and ghastly denizens of the underworld
  -all with flashy new towers, levels, heroes, and more
  goodies to help you crush your foes to a pulp. (Don't
  worry, we've still got all the good ol' stuff from the last
  game, too. It's vintage now.)

  Kingdom Rush: Frontiers packs in so much content, it's like
  a fully upgraded artillery blast of mouthwatering,
  pixelated joy launched right into your smiling little
  face... and it hurts so good!
