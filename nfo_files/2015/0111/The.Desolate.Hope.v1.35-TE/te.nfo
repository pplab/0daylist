        On a distant edge of an unknown planet, an abandoned structure
        sits in silence. Constructed by an unmanned research vessel sent
        from Earth, the Lun Infinus station was designed to run
        simulations for a five year period, exploring possibilities of
        human colonization in the case that Earth became uninhabitable.
        Developed during an age of ambition and wealth, the project was
        quickly abandoned when interest faded in the following years. 

        The last transmission from Earth occurred more than thirty years
        ago. The Lun Infinus station contained five sentient computers,
        Derelicts, built with certain levels of mobility in the case of
        emergency or need for relocation. Each of these Derelicts was to
        formulate their own plan for colonization based on thousands of
        hours of simulations. Given the amount of time that has passed
        however, the simulations have become very elaborate and bizarre.
        Meanwhile however, a mysterious computer virus has emerged. The
        virus of unknown origins has been slowly ravaging the Derelicts.
        Because of this, more and more CPU processing power has been
        needed for anti-virus measures, leaving less power for the
        simulations. Coffee is the last mobile resident of the station, a
        small service robot who spends his days keeping the station and
        the Derelicts operational as they perform their daily tasks.
        Since CPU power is slim, Coffee has been cutting corners to find
        ways around the virus. By using small subsystems and less vital
        CPU's scattered through the station in lesser devices, Coffee has
        designed a line of digital helpers, each simply called a D-Co, or
        "Digital Counterpart", to assist him in fighting the virus and
        keeping the station operational. Eventually the virus gets the
        best of each D-Co, and Coffee tries to create an improved D-Co
        using a different CPU. The latest is D-Co 9, built using the code
        of a simple computer game. Coffee dedicates his own CPU to be
        used for the main simulations, putting D-Co in charge of moving
        his body throughout the station, taking care of the needs of the
        Derelicts, and fighting off virus attacks when they occur. 


        GAMEPLAY: 

        The Desolate Hope mixes several gameplay styles. On the station
        and in the simulations, the game is a platformer. You will shoot
        enemies, collect powerups and bits (money) and upgrade yourself
        and your virtual battlers. When you enter a mini-simulation (the
        old arcade style screens) then the game becomes an 8-bit overhead
        dungeon crawler. There you can farm money and gain options to
        customize your battle experiences. When you encounter a virus
        boss, the game shifts to a JRPG style battle where you must use
        the mouse to select from your various options to defeat your
        opponent. Almost everything outside of these battles is aimed at
        upgrading your abilities and increasing your stats for these
        fights, they are the real challenge of the game.
