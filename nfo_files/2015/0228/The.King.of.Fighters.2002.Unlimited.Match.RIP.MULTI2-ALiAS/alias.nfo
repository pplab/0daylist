     The second title in the UM series is a fully upgraded version of          
     KOF 2002, a masterpiece of the KOF series deserving of a place

     graphics and background music have been completely redone and the         
     game balance has also been extensively redesigned. New moves have         
     been added and others have been brought back, meaning that players        
     can enjoy battling it out for longer than ever.
