        It's one year after the collapse of civilisation and hedge fund
        manager Joe Wheeler emerges from his specially constructed bunker
        in search of food. This is a story-driven survival game where the
        aim is to find other survivors, gain their respect, and build a
        community. You'll have to maintain a steady insulin supply for a
        diabetic woman, solve the mystery of why certain people have
        disappeared from a nearby community, and search for a truck full
        of stolen gold bullion that will make you unimaginably wealthy in
        the new gold-based economy. You'll scavenge for supplies, trade,
        plant crops, go on quests, face moral dilemmas, go to war, and
        uncover dark, terrible secrets! Or you could just kill everyone
        you meet, it probably won't get you very far but the choice is
        yours.


        Requirements:

        ∑ Operating System: Windows XP or later, in theory
        ∑ Graphics Card: Any card that supports DirectX10 should do it


        You probably already have these on your PC but if not you'll need
        to install them:

        Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 Refresh 
        http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=27598

        Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 Client Profile
