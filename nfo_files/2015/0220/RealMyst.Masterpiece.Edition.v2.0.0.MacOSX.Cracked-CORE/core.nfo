€≤    realMYST for today's Mac computers - celebrating the 20th             ≤€
€≤    anniversary of Myst! The models and textures have been                ≤€
€≤    reconstructed to provide an amazing graphical experience. The         ≤€
€≤    environments have been enhanced to provide dynamic water, weather,    ≤€
€≤    lighting, foliage, focus, and more. The interface has been            ≤€
€≤    redesigned to provide an enjoyable way to explore for both novices    ≤€
€≤    and gamers.                                                           ≤€

€≤    realMyst: Masterpiece Edition - this is not your father's Myst!       ≤€
€≤    It's been 20 years since Myst became your world, and there's never    ≤€
€≤    been a better time to revisit the Ages. This newly refreshed and      ≤€
€≤    rebuilt version of realMyst is all-things Myst, but amazingly more    ≤€
€≤    real. You can explore anywhere, unfettered, and in realtime! Pick     ≤€
€≤    your own path through the forest on Myst Island. Listen to the        ≤€
€≤    crickets as the sun sets in the Channelwood Age. Relax in the         ≤€
€≤    falling leaves in the Selenitic Age. Spin around for a full           ≤€
€≤    panoramic tour of Sirrus' throne room. Seek shelter from the          ≤€
€≤    thunderstorm in Stoneship Age.                                        ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    And If you've ever been overwhelmed by realtime 3D - too many         ≤€
€≤    controls or too much motion - realMyst has something for you! You     ≤€
€≤    have the option to play the game just like the original Myst -        ≤€
€≤    with a simple point and click! Point where you want to go - click     ≤€
€≤    the mouse and you move through the world seamlessly to the new        ≤€
€≤    location. As a tribute to Myst's 20th anniversary we've also added    ≤€
€≤    the original Myst images when you play in this Classic mode. Hold     ≤€
€≤    down the shift key and the original Myst image pops up, so you can    ≤€
€≤    see the difference and fondly remember that early Myst experience.    ≤€
€≤                                                                          ≤€
€≤    We've added plenty of new features to enhance and assist you on       ≤€
€≤    your journey. So whether you're visiting Myst for the first time      ≤€
€≤    or you want to remember the first time - there's never been a         ≤€
€≤    better reason to lose yourself and let the surrealistic Ages of       ≤€
