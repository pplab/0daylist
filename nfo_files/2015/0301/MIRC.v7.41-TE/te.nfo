        mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows
        that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others
        on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group
        conferences or in one-to-one private discussions. 

        It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable
        and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers,
        multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support,
        UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray
        notifications, message logging, and more. 

        mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both
        to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide
        range of functions from network communications to playing games. 

        mIRC has been in development for over a decade and is constantly
        being improved and updated with new technologies. The most recent
        changes can be found on the latest news page. 


        Whats New?

        mIRC 7.41 has been released! (February 28th 2015) 

        This is a small update that addresses a number of issues reported
        by users since the last release. It includes improvements,
        changes and fixes to a number of features, including: 

        ∑ Added $calc() // floor divide operator. 
        ∑ Fixed MDI window transparency bug under Windows 8. 
        ∑ Fixed file handling bug that would have caused settings to be
          reset if there was a drive error. 
        ∑ Fixed connection timeout not being applied while a STARTTLS
          handshake is in progress. 
        ∑ Reverted Channels List window change so that modes are included
          in the listing again. 
        ∑ Fixed MDI windows not maximizing fully to the right in some
          situations. 
        ∑ Fixed Log and Buffer submenus in window system menus not being
          set correctly. 
        ∑ Fixed confirm exit dialog bug that was not detecting if DCC
          gets were in progress. 
        ∑ Extended SSL support to allow connecting to SNI servers. 
        ∑ Fixed log reload bug that caused logs not to be reloaded before
          the start of a new year. 
        ∑ Fixed while loop bugs relating to multiple nested while loop
          combinations. 
        ∑ Fixed log viewer bug that caused it to freeze during a search. 
        ∑ Other changes and bug fixes. 

        In total there have been around 40 changes since the last release
        and although most of them are only small fixes and tweaks, we
        hope that they result in a more useful and stable mIRC for you.

        Install mirc741.exe.  After installation copy precracked exe from
        the Crack folder to the installed folder of mIRC.  Launch mIRC
        and use ANY information for registration.  You now have a fully
        activated version of mIRC!  This version is also compatible with
        the fish_10, just make sure you install the latest version of
        fish_10.


        IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PORTABLE INSTALL:

        If you choose to make a portable install while doing the
        installation its important to note that the registration info is
        then stored in mIRC.ini on your portable device.  If you copy
        over your mIRC.ini from your Windows Program Files/User
        installation of mIRC, then when you launch mIRC it will ask for a
        key again (if you have entered one before) because this time it
        started to look in your registry.

        Either don't copy your old ini over, or make sure to find, then
        copy and paste the [user] section from the portable version ini
        into your old ini you plan on using.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
