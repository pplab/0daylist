        Spoiler Alert is a video game that tests your platforming
        skillsÖ in reverse. Itís a comedy platformer that you play
        backwards. 

        When you pick this game up, it has already been beaten. The big
        bad boss is defeated, the coins are collected and the princess
        has been rescued. Why, oh why? 

        Unraveling this mystery takes you through the entire game, from
        the last level to the first. You must uncollect the coins, revive
        the enemies and avoid nasty time paradoxes. In other words, you
        must uncomplete the game by playing it backwards. 

        Everything in this game is so familiar, yet so different and new.
        You have played it a thousand times before, and at the same time,
        you have never tried anything like it.
