     Redux: Dark Matters is an ultra hot classic shmup and definitely a        
     must have for every shmup fan. Released successfully at the               
     beginning of 2014 as a brandnew Dreamcast game in limited edition -       
     now the games comes as a beautiful super sharp 16:9/720p and 1080p        
     full HD PC version on Steam for worldwide distribution right before       
     the same year ends!                                                       
                                                                               
     Redux: Dark Matters is a fast-paced space shooting game with fresh        
     scoring elements and some review called the game a bastard-hard           
     shooter. However, you have to master 7 stages with different              
     ambiance which is indeed anything but easy - not yet spoken of the        
     boss encounters. Always watch out since each and every thing is           
     loaded with whatever to discover. Your ship is armed with rapid           
     fire, sub-weapons, rockets and more - in other words with all you         
     need to make it through - it depends on you!                              
                                                                               
     The story takes place in the year 2067, when the ìSpace Forceî            
     organisation was exploring the galaxy for new strong and powerful         
     materials to produce more powerful battle ships they discovered a         
     space mine on a strange asteroid on the enemy territories. The            
     scientists now began to analyze the material and concluded they had       
     found the one material to build the best space ship ever.                 
                                                                               
     One year later, the prototype was finished and the test results           
     show unmatched battle power. However, the material seemed to be           
     unstable and the use of the assembled ship was highly risky but           
     since the Evil threat, was close to destroy the whole universe, the       
     organisation was forced to let the ship fly.                              
                                                                               
     NOW, go to experience the highlights of the game - pilot your space       
     ship, blast off the mechanized servants of evil and save the world!
