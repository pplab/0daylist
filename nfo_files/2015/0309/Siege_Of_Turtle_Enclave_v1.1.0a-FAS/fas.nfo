  Siege of Turtle Enclave is a turn based strategy war game with real time
  battles, it's set in a vibrant and inviting fantasy world where the last
  remnant of a nation of turtles valiantly makes a stand against the ravaging
  hordes of corrupt owls which have wrested away most of the turtle's
  homeland. Over the course of the game players will research technologies,
  build up their settlement, train armies, and fight their way across the map
  in an attempt to overthrow the enemy warlord in his keep. Along the way,
  players will find goodie huts, collect resources from the map, and recruit
  powerful heroes to fight alongside their armies. Each play through will be
  different, as the campaign map is randomly generated at the start of each
  new game, adding to the game's replay value.
 
  Battles are fought between armies consisting of up to 12 units each, with
  each side deploying up to 6 units onto the field and the remainder kept in
  reserve to replace fallen or wounded units as the battle proceeds. Each unit
  has a Damage Type and an Alignment, these two factors combine to determine
  how much damage deals to another unit in a kind of 'dual-rock-paper-
  scissors' system, countering Damage Types increases damage, whereas
  countering Alignment types reduce incoming damage. Units will also gain
  levels as they fight, increasing their HP, Attack, Defense, and Stamina.
  Stamina is used for special abilities, unlocked when a unit reaches lvl 3
  and some units get a second one at level 6, and it's also used for
  attacking/defending, running out of Stamina will result in de-buffs and
  reduced combat efficiency.
