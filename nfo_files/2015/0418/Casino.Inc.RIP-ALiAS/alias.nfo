     Classic strategy game from 2003. Run your own casino in the 1970s.        
     It's classy. It's glitzy. It's all yours. Take a gamble. Start            
     small with a slot machine or two. Employ some staff and open the          
     doors. Pretty soon people will be talking about your place from           
     coast to coast.                                                           
                                                                               
     Visitor profiles vary from wealthy businessmen, professional              
     gamblers to trailer trash and holiday flutterers. All have tastes         
     to suit their budget and style. Teenagers seek noisy arcade               
     machines, and high rollers want big stakes and big returns. They          
     all have one thing in common: cash to spend.                              
                                                                               
     As you grow to own hotels and casinos you'll want to set the amount       
     of floor space given to rooms, bar and restaurant areas, roulette,        
     card tables, slot machines, entertainment lounges, and to also set        
     the level of payouts, profits and cream offs on the tables and            
     machines. You will be able to see, in high detail, which of your          
     outfits are popular. The graphical scale allows you to track the          
     ebb and flow of the city at a zoomed out perspective, but then to         
     zoom inside your buildings to see the gamblers playing Black Jack         
     at the tables.                                                            
                                                                               
     You can actively encourage the growth of the city by your actions.        
     This is a tourist town; it has a multitude of businesses that very        
     visibly attract customers if popular; the airport and roads become        
     busy. The streets get choked. The tills ring more frequently. And,        
     provided you're taking care of business, the profits will roll in.
