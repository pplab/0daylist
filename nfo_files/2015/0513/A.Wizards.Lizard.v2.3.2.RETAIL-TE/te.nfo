        Conquer the forces of Death in A Wizardís Lizard, an action RPG
        for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Explore ever-changing dungeons
        filled with valuable treasure and powerful items, while battling
        back the hordes of evil. Rescue townsfolk to improve your town
        and aid your next trek into the dungeon.

        Fans of The Legend of Zelda, Gauntlet, and The Binding of Isaac
        will love the retro-inspired twin-stick action of A Wizard's
        Lizard.

        When the wizard of Amberfall unlocks the magic of eternal life,
        Death comes to take him away. Now his faithful pet lizard must
        brave procedurally-generated dungeons to save him!

        Master Life & Death: Death is only the beginning as you continue
        to unlock secrets in the realm of the dead. Find hidden items
        only accessible to those who have died and discover the power of
        resurrection. Tread carefully, the dead do not wish to be
        disturbed.

        Rebuild the Town: Rescue townsfolk trapped throughout the
        dungeons for increasing reward. Discover lost blueprints which
        allow the town's blacksmith to craft new weapons and armor.

        Restore the Museum: Search Death's domain for stolen artifacts
        and legendary weapons. Every item you find is returned to the
        museum for display. Can you recover all of the powerful weapons,
        legendary armor, and magical items?

        Control your lizard using your favorite gamepad (including the
        Xbox 360 controller) for full 360 degree movement and attacking.
