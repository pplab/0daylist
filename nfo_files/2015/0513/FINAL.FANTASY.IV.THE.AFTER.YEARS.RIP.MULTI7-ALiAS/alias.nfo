     Now with a full 3-D remake, FINAL FANTASY IV: THE AFTER YEARS can         
     now be played as never before on PC. Take part in the epic sequel         
     that unfolds nearly two decades after the events of FINAL FANTASY         
     IV. Classic characters make their return alongside several new            
     heroes, such as Ceodore, son of Cecil and Rosa.                           
     Story : Seventeen years have passed since the war's end, and the          
     son born to King Cecil and Queen Rosa of Baron has grown into a           
     young man. Prince Ceodore has enlisted in the airship fleet known         
     as the Red Wings, eager to meet the expectations demanded of his          
     blood and station. Yet once more another moon has appeared in the         
     sky, and with it vast hordes of monsters intent on destruction. The       
     brief peace enjoyed by the Blue Planet now stands threatened under        
     the shadow of impending catastrophe.                                      
     Ten Playable Tales                                                        
     Begin your journey with "Ceodore's Tale." Complete it to unlock the       
     tales of six additional characters, which can be played in any            
     order, and then return to the core story with "Kain's Tale," "The         
     Lunarian's Tale," and "The Crystals." A total of ten tales in all,        
     and all contained in FINAL FANTASY IV: THE AFTER YEARS.                   
                                                                               
     Active Time Battle                                                        
     Take control of exhilarating combat made possible by the non-stop         
     action in Square Enix's iconic battle system.

     Feel the moon's presence in combat, as its waxing and waning              
     influences the potency of attacks and abilities of all combatants.        
     Lunar phases cycle naturally with the passage of in-game time, or
