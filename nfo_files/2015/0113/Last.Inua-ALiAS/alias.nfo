     captivating experience, Last Inua tells the tale of an Inuit              
     familyís fight for survival against a fearsome demon and the harsh        
     elements of the mythical Arctic.                                          
                                                                               
     The Tonrar, a demonic trickster, has awoken in the Arctic. The            
     mythical powers that are still very active in this part of the            
     world are under severe threat. The Tonrar is spreading his darkness       
     that is taking over both the physical aspects (ice, snow and caves)       
     but also the mythological. The Inuit gods, giant mythical                 
     creatures; the Ice Bear, the Raven and the Narwhal are all under          
     threat by the Tonrar. They are slowly losing their power, health          
     and sanity - infected by this darkness. Hiko and Ataataq are the          
     only hope, yet Hiko is physically and will need to rely on the            
     brute strength of his powerhouse father, Ataataq.                         
                                                                               
     Guiding Hiko, his physically weak but gifted son along this epic          
     journey, Ataataq will need to rely on his brute strength to               
     overcome many obstacles. Hiko, although more fragile than his             
     father, carries with him supernatural abilities and magical skills        
     that exceed the physical powers of his father.                            
                                                                               
     Together, Ataataq and Hiko must traverse the arctic landscape and         
     visit The Trinity of the Mythical Creatures to help defeat the            
     malevolent Tonrar. Physically weak and fragile, Hiko will need the        
     help of his father to reach the end of this wondrous tale.
