     Vertiginous Golf is a dystopian steam punk mini golf adventure game       
     set in the skies above an alternate world where life on the ground        
     is enveloped in permanent smog, constant darkness and never-ending        
     rain.                                                                     
                                                                               
     After suffering on the ground under a haze smog and pollution, the        
     people of Scudburough have been split in half by a lottery, with          
     the winners heading up into the clouds to live in a floating city         
     called New Lun-Donne. For those left below, they can get a                
     temporary escape from the gloom through the Verti-Sphere, a device        
     that allows them to rise virtually into the cloudy paradise to play       
     mini golf on challenging obstacle courses floating in the sky. But        
     something is amiss in this nation of two cities. Another voice is         
     trying to break through the propaganda messages of peace and              
     prosperityÖ the voice of an insurrection.                                 
                                                                               
     Chip and putt your way through beautiful golf courses floating far        
     above the smog-covered streets below. Play through the unique story       
     mode courses to uncover the mystery of the Verti-sphere. Enjoy 54         
     classic holes ranging from simple miniputt to mind-bending courses        
     that will test even the most skilled golfers, as well a driving           
     range and race challenges.                                                
                                                                               
     Take on these insane obstacle courses filled with hazards and             
     contraptions. Look through the eyes of your mechanical hummingbird        
     companion to explore and unlock the secrets of the green. Use the         
     jewel encrusted beetle to control your ball once itís in motion and       
     make good use of your limited rewind power to redeem yourself from        
     a bad shot.
