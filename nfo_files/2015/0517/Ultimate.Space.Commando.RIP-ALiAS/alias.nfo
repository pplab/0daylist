     Ultimate Space Commando (USC) is a turn-based sci-fi tactics game         
     with strategy and role-playing elements, inspired by many                 
     "old-school" top-down view classics, featuring a semi-randomized          
     Campaign mode with real multiple ending possibilities, fully              
     interactive random maps, a detailed combat system with 18 distinct        
     weapons and in-depth mechanics, a lot of unique gadgets,                  
     customizable squads with craftable goodies and lootable weapon            
     prototypes, TCP/IP-based and hot-seat multiplayer modes, and an           
     alien horde not stopped even by walls to fulfill its terrifying           
     agenda...                                                                 
                                                                               
     USC is a complex game. From training your units with skill points         
     and outfitting your squads with the appropriate weapons, ammo and         
     additional gear to exploring, salvaging resources and fighting the        
     alien horde, everything is in your hands. The game mechanics are          
     easy to learn, but mastering them is a grand journey. USC features        
     seven difficulty levels for custom games and three for the Campaign       
     mode, including Easy for learners or casual players, but beating          
     the highest levels requires both sophisticated tactics and a great        
     deal of planning ahead with resources and synergy between                 
     environment, weapons and items.                                           
                                                                               
     Features:                                                                 
                                                                               
     Campaign mode: Follow and control the fate of the crew of U.S.C.          
     Wraith, a recon vessel stranded on an isolated mining planet,             
     facing a rather unpleasant "first contact" scenario with the              
     greatest threat to mankind yet. Unravel the hidden aspects of the         
     story and try to save all your men and/or defeat the aliens while         
     fighting through 30+ semi-randomized missions, gathering resources        
     and item blueprints in an attempt to contact Earth.                       
                                                                               
     ?Fully interactive, randomized combat environment: All map elements       
     are interactive in some way. Gather ammo, Credits, blueprints or          
     items from crates, loot vending machines for refreshment, struggle        
     to seal blast doors to prevent further alien intrusions, hack             
     locked doors in a mini-game, use flammable objects to burn your           
     enemies, find switches to unlock special areas, move almost any           
     kind of objects to make a barricade, bring down walls for an escape       
     route or to gain an advantage, avoid various hazards, and more...         
     all this on randomly generated maps in three distinct environments!       
                                                                               
     ?Detailed combat mechanics and squad management: USC features a           
     unique combat system based on four combat stats (Health, Morale,          
     Action Points and Armor), nine RPG-like attributes (weapon class          
     proficiencies, reaction, electrotechnics, etc.) and various attack        
     properties (e.g. accuracy, impact force, armor penetration, and           
     many more). 18 weapons, more than 30 useful gadgets (medikits,            
     weapon & armor mods, cloaking device, deployable auto-turret, etc.)       
     and even prototype weapons and craftable-only special items are           
     available to choose from as you see fit for your tactics. Your            
     units gain experience in the Campaign mode, but your customized           
     squads can also make progress with their gear even in other game          
     modes!                                                                    
                                                                               
     ?Various custom game modes: Beside the Campaign, you can also play        
     the "Defend the Base!" mode--where you get to build your very own         
     base, manage your resources and fight multiple waves of aliens--and       
     fully customizable Single Missions, where you can specify the             
     objectives for each team, set map size and other parameters,              
     difficulty, player handicaps, etc.                                        
                                                                               
     ?Multiplayer: You don't have to play alone! You can play with             
     friends either over TCP/IP protocol or in hot-seat mode up to four        
     players! You can create co-op PvE, PvP and even mixed PvPvE games!

     sci-fi horror audio experience! 16+16 original music tracks,
