     'Unlimited escape' is an action / strategy game with unpredictable        
     dynamics.                                                                 
                                                                               
     The protagonist of the game will walk and explore endless mazes           
     procedurally generated and will have a single mission: to save the        
     prisoners scattered in the path leading them to the point of rescue.      
                                                                               
     The main character must also defend these prisoners from the              
     enemies that appear in every part of the playing field.                   
                                                                               
     The main feature of the game is the complete procedural generation        
     of scenarios and lighting, which allows an unlimited variety of play.     
                                                                               
     With the advance of the levels, the game scenarios are becoming           
     larger and intricate, with ever greater dangers.                          
                                                                               
     The number of game levels is unlimited, and the game stores               
     statistics and many score rankings to increase the charm and              
     challenge.                                                                
                                                                               
     The aim of the game is to save a number of prisoners in the maze          
     of each level, and to do this you have to group them and bring them       
     to a save point placed randomly within the maze.                          
                                                                               
     In the path appear enemies that chase you and kill the prisoners          
     who need to save. When you will shoot the enemies you have to be          
     careful not to kill the prisoners to save.                                
                                                                               
     The groups of prisoners are scattered randomly in the path of each        
     level, and to find them you'll have to explore the maze by seeking        
     help from the map on the top screen.                                      
                                                                               
     Enemy bases are scattered randomly in the path, and these bases           
     are colored red. The save point instead is colored blue.                  
                                                                               
     Each level is a maze that is always different, unpredictable and          
     randomly generated, as well as lights and lighting used in the            
     level. In this way the game dynamics are always new.                      
                                                                               
     The number of levels is infinite, as well as the score that can be        
     achieved. Are stored up to 100 high scores and statistics, so we          
     challenge everyone to become legends and heroes!                          
                                                                               
     With the advance of the levels, the game gets bigger, richer and          
     difficult. The number of enemy bases increase with advancing              
     levels, as the number of prisoners to be saved.
