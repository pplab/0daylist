     This expansion for Infested Planet gives you several new weapons to       
     fight the bugs. Whether it's throwing cluster bombs into the alien        
     swarms or calling in an airdrop, the power is at your fingertips.         
                                                                               
     The aliens also get new toys, so brace yourself for new opposition.       
     Compete with others on the Ironman leaderboard and watch out for          
     the new aliens and structures.

     - New Mutator alien structure                                             
                                                                               
     Command a team of 5 elite soldiers against an alien horde of              
     100,000. Surrounded on all sides, you must outmaneuver and outsmart       
     the enemy.                                                                
                                                                               
     The enemy is closing in around you. Your soldiers are being flanked       
     and the perimeter is slowly collapsing under a vicious alien              
     assault. Robotic turrets will not last much longer. Just a little         
     more and the bugs will swarm into your unprotected base. What are         
     your orders?                                                              
                                                                               
     You order your soldiers to fall back to a defensive chokepoint and        
     rebuild your defenses. Sacrifice the forward squads to gain some          
     extra time. Gather your team while equipping them with                    
     flamethrowers and laser guns. Start building a siege cannon for           
     fire support. Then, while the aliens are busy, flank their main           
     hives to destroy and capture them.                                        
                                                                               
     You have just pulled off a tactical victory - but there's no time         
     to rest.                                                                  
                                                                               
     The aliens are constantly mutating. One moment your shotguns are          
     ripping through the horde, the next the aliens grow hard,                 
     bullet-proof armour. You must adapt as well. Equip your team with         
     stealth suits, miniguns, grenade launchers - your commands will           
     decide the battle's outcome.
