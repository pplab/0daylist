€≤    DropDMG is the easiest way to create Mac OS X disk images, as well    ≤€
€≤    as cross-platform archives. Just drag and drop a folder or file       ≤€
€≤    and you're done. Or, you can drag an existing disk image or           ≤€
€≤    archive onto DropDMG to convert it to any of the other supported      ≤€
€≤    formats or to burn it to CD or DVD.                                   ≤€

€≤    Disk images pack entire folders or disks into a single compressed     ≤€
€≤    file, either for transport across the Internet or simply for          ≤€
€≤    backup. They are the only archive format whose contents you can       ≤€
€≤    directly access in the Finder, without the potentially slow and       ≤€
€≤    disk-consuming step of expanding the files into a folder.             ≤€
