        DanceWall Remix is an all new gaming experience, designed for
        natural gesture recognition with web camera, and does not require
        the use of any physical controllers to play. No controls, no
        barriers to fun. Just move your body in front of the camera to
        control the gameplay. DanceWall Remix is an experience enjoyed by
        anyone, young and old, that will have players off the couch and
        moving throughout the room to control all the in-game action. 

        In DanceWall Remix, players make physical body poses that
        transform their onscreen avatars to fit through approaching
        silhouette shapes on screen. The goal is to earn the highest
        score by making the best possible fit with these onscreen
        silhouettes, picking up bonuses, and avoiding obstacles. The
        physical gameplay is immediately intuitive and does not require
        any previous experience with video games to quickly enjoy the
        fun. 

        DanceWall Remix is divided into three themes, Disco, Classic, and
        Retro. Each theme has a distinct look and style of play based on
        the music. Retro is an 8Bit inspired synthetic world of
        Electronic music. Classic is a ìBubblegum-Popî world where
        everything is soft and cute, and Disco is thematic of a 70ís
        nightclub. 

        Each level supports three modes of play: single player, 2 player
        cooperative and 2 player versus.
