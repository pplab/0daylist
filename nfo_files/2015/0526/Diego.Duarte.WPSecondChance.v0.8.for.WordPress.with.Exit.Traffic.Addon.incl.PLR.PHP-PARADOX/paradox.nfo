| You can use our plugin to send traffic to any URL of your choice.       |

| or any other.                                                           |
|                                                                         |
| Behind the scenes, our plugin will also add each one of your visitors   |
| to an invisible list.                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| ...a powerful list to keep selling to your visitors!                    |
|                                                                         |
| This list is hosted under your Facebook advertising account (they call  |
| it "audiences") and it allows you to create ads that target these       |
| visitors!                                                               |
|                                                                         |
| This means that from now on, you will be also able to directly          |
| advertise to these people!                                              |
|                                                                         |
| From now on, you can create Facebook advertising campaigns to sell      |
| related offers, discounts and more... directly to these visitors!       |
|                                                                         |
| And Your Ads Will Follow Them Everywhere!                               |
|                                                                         |
| This advertising system (adding people to "invisible" lists so you can  |
| later target them through Facebook ads to sell them related offers) is  |
| called "retargeting".                                                   |
|                                                                         |
| The problem that most internet marketers experience is how to           |
| implement retargeting on sites that they don't control/own.             |
|                                                                         |
| Sites like Teespring, Amazon, eBay, affiliate sites..                   |
|                                                                         |
| The good news: now you can!                                             |
|                                                                         |
| With our plugin you can easily add retargeting to any URL!              |
|                                                                         |
| Yes, you can send your visitors to ANY URL and they will be ALL added   |
| to your Facebook list! And everything with zero coding!                 |
|                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                                                         |
| The Exit Traffic Addon is included:                                     |
|                                                                         |
| Show your ads over external sites when your visitors try to leave them  |
| and get a second chance to monetise non-buyers.                         |
|                                                                         |
| Take WPSecondChance to the next level and get more leads and sales!     |
|                                                                         |
| When someone tries to leave a website that you're recommending, the     |
| addon will allow you to show an ad over that external site.             |
|                                                                         |
| And this will automatically give you a second chance to sell to these   |
| visitors!                                                               |
|                                                                         |
| Use it to collect leads! Use it to sell related offers! Use it to make  |
| your affiliate links go viral! And more!                                |
|                                                                         |
| And of course (as this addon works together with WPSecondChance), you   |
| can also add each one of these visitors to a Facebook list!             |
|                                                                         |
| Add your "exit ads" to lots of external websites!                       |
|                                                                         |
| Some websites (like Amazon, eBay, YouTube, Teespring, Fiverr and        |
| others) use a technical implementation (called "same origin policy")    |
| that doesn't let you show external content on their sites (the addon    |
| won't work with them).                                                  |
|                                                                         |
| The good news is that the plugin can be used with lots of sites and     |
| affiliate networks that don't adopt this policy.                        |
|                                                                         |
| (In those sites where you can't show exit pop-ups, you can still link   |
| to them (Amazon, eBay etc) and put every visitor into your Facebook     |
| list!)                                                                  |
|                                                                         |
