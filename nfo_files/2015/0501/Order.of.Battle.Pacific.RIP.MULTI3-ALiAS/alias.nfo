     Set in Pacific theater of WW2, Order of Battle: Pacific features          
     playable campaigns for both the US-led Allies and the Japanese            
     Empire. Starting from the attack on Pearl Harbor, the dynamic             
     campaign system allows players to alter the course of history and         
     even win the war as Japan in the fictional ìwhat-ifî conquest of          
     Australia, or lead the Allied forces from the struggle at the             
     beginning of the war to ultimate victory with the invasion of Japan.      
                                                                               
     With a selection of over 500 unique looking and behaving units,           
     players can build and manage their army and fleet throughout the          
     campaign. Early units include the iconic M3 Stuart, Type 97 Chi-Ha,       
     A6M Zero and F4U Corsair fighters. As new technology becomes              
     available, players eventually gain access to high-tech and                
     prototype units such as the Nakajima Kikka and P-80 Shooting Star         
     jet-fighters, Montana and Super Yamato Class battleships and T28,         
     T29 and Type 100 I/O heavy tanks.                                         
                                                                               
     A unique system of Specializations allows players to customize            
     their forces with special units, bonuses and abilities that reflect       
     the difference in strategies and mentality of the opposing sides.         
     Focus on the merciless Japanese fighting spirit with Banzai Charge        
     and Bushido Code, establish supply advantages with the Tokyo              
     Express, or gain access to B29 Nuclear Bombers through the                
     Manhattan Project.                                                        
                                                                               
     A set of unique Commanders ñ split between Generals, Pilots and           
     Captains ñ is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. Commanders can         
     be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything       
     in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics          
     remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the       
     balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in              
     defense to turn the tide to your favor.
