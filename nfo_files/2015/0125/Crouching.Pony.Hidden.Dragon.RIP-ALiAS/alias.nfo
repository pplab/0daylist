     SenseÔ is the undisputed chieftain. His followers are well versed         
     in every extortion, infiltration and martial art. Pony and Biki are       
     his best students, his pride and joy. The duo knows the secret            
     chakra technique like the back of their hand (or hoof in Pony's           
     case). Together they rule the city and its surroundings. Although         
     everyone respects and fears them they are hunted by law enforcement       
     agencies.

     Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon (CPHD) is a brand-new Action/RPG game        
     developed for SNKís Neo Geo console which came out in 1990.               
                                                                               
     It might look like a straight-forward arcade game, but under the          
     surface is a persistent world with a rich and varied set of rules.        
     In CPHD ìRuníN Gunî mechanics from the likes Shock Troopers or            
     Ninja commando are combined with playful ìRPGî ones from games like       
     Zelda or Secret of Mana.                                                  
                                                                               
     You'll need to explore every level to find the resources necessary        
     for your progress: coins, health bonuses, resurrection potions,           
     special Ninja techniques, etc. Treasure chests are hidden                 
     everywhere. Youíll have to find them to afford equipment upgrades         
     from the ninja shops. In addition Pony and Biki gain experience           
     points by defeating enemies, becoming more powerful over time. Be         
     careful though: youíll have to use your resources wisely. Health is       
     limited so if you don't equip yourself at the armory you're in for        
     a hard time. Money is limited too however: you'll need to choose          
     these investments carefully!                                              
                                                                               
     Make new friends: a local multiplayer co-op mode lets a second            
     player drop in at any time. Itís even more fun, even more frantic         
     and even more strategic!                                                  
                                                                               
     Lose old friends: there are the same numbers of resources no matter       
     how many players there are; will you share or will you hog                
     everything?
