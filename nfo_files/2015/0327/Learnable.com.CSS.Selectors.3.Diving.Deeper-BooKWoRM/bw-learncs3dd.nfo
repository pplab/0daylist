    Over three lessons you will gain a detailed knowledge of a range of
    different selectors including the User-interface pseudo-classes,
    Pseudo-elements and the negation pseudo-class. With each selector you

    support. Each aspect of the course includes detailed slides and hands
    on exercises.
