  > Description <

    In CSS, the cascade is everything — there’s a hint why in its name.
    If you don’t understand how CSS rules are applied by browsers, you
    are in for a world of pain.
    
    Over a series of five lessons, you’ll learn how browsers sort
    declarations to determine which selectors will “win”. The course
    includes a series of hands-on exercises on all aspects of the cascade
    from user style sheets to !important rules, specificity and more.
