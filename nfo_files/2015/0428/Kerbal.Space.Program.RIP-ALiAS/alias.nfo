     In KSP you must build a space-worthy craft, capable of flying its         
     crew out into space without killing them. At your disposal is a           
     collection of parts, which must be assembled to create a functional       
     ship. Each part has its own function and will affect the way a ship       
     flies (or doesn't). So strap yourself in, and get ready to try some       
     Rocket Science!                                                           
                                                                               
     The game offers three gameplay modes: Sandbox, in which you are           
     free to build anything you can think of; Science Mode, which lets         
     you perform Scientific experiments to advance the knowledge of            
     Kerbalkind and further the available technology; and Career Mode,         
     in which you must manage every aspect of your Space Program,              
     including administration strategies, Crew Management, Reputation,         
     as well as taking up Contracts to earn Funds and upgrade your Space       
     Center Facilities (or repair them).                                       
                                                                               
     Add to this the ability to capture asteroids (a feature done in           
     collaboration with NASA), Mining for resources out across the             
     furthest reaches of the Solar System, Constructing Bases and Space        
     Stations in and around other worlds; plus literally thousands of          
     mods from a huge active modding community, all add up into the            
     award-winning game that has taken the space sim genre by storm.
