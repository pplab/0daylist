        The ultimate health monitoring tool for your hard disks

        Hard disks are the long term memory of your PC. And just like
        your memory, they degrade over time. Fragmented file systems
        cause longer access times and mechanical wear and tear inevitably
        leads to data loss and drive failure. Nearly 10% of all hard
        disks already wear out in their third year of operation. 

        Ashampoo HDD Control 3 jogs the memory of your PC. Lower access
        times, remove resource hogs, prevent data loss and detect signs
        of failure early on.
