  Another Star is a console-style RPG with a fast-paced battle system and a
  world that encourages players to explore and discover hidden areas as they
  lead their party on a journey across a fantasy world. While clearly
  influenced by the style and gameplay of the past, the game also implements
  innovations and ideas from the present. Random battles are less intrusive
  than classic console RPGs, alerting the player when enemies have been
  encountered, but giving them the choice to accept and fight, or ignore and
  continue exploring.
 
  Inspired by the 26th Ludum Dare competition theme of Minimalism, Another
  Star uses a single 128 ◊ 128 tile sheet to craft a vast and varied world for
  players to experience. While some retro games focus on parody and humor,
  Another Star lets its plot play out on its own weight to evoke the
  atmosphere of storytelling in an age when storage space was tight and every
  word had to count.
 
  The game is presented using an optional CRT filter to emulate the look and
  feel of classic eight bit consoles. Additionally, the game's soundtrack is
  composed using samples from the Yamaha YM2413, a budget-priced FM that was
  built into or used as an add-on in several systems of the era.
 
  Features:
  ~~~~~~~~~
  - An entire game packed into just 256 eight by eight pixel tiles!
  - Optional CRT filter, originally developed for console emulators, that can
    be enabled and disabled at any time.
  - Over 30 original music tracks composed using actual samples from the
    Yamaha YM2413 FM chip.
  - Approximately 20 hours of gameplay for the main storyline.
  - Secret areas are hidden everywhere. Those who explore are sure to be well
    rewarded.
  - Over a dozen dungeons to delve into and conquer, some hidden off the
    beaten path.
  - Five difficulty levels, giving each player a chance to beat the game on
    their own terms.
  - Four levels of character growth speed, including an "Old School" setting
    for those who love to grind for EXP.
  - Both the game difficulty and character growth can be customized at any
    time from the options menu!
